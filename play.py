October 30c/40c. Just closed it for a 100 percent return. The crazy wide bid ask spreads make it difficult to get the best price. Glad to take it The volume just makes me nervous I had a 49c 6/12 I was sitting on and sold this morning for 1.6, didn't notice until after I sold that it had *one* volume lmao You have been chosen to buy the DKNG dip. &#x200B; 50c 6/19 1. If I put $100k cash into my IB account, I can buy $400k of S&P500? 2. I'd get liquidated if SPY loses more than 25% of its value `400k*0.25`? 3. I had this idea. I can buy an asset for free by using the difference between cost of borrowing loan (1.5%) and return of the stonk market (7.5%). 6% of $300K = $18K/yr. Its free money (as long as FED printers run). No? 4. Not sure what asset would make sense to buy though Too late for SWBI 6/19 20C? hey look at me i'm a bear i'm going to bleed 9/10 of my money away over the course of the year so i can brag about doubling what remains of my account once every decade We haven�t even had any sports announcements yet this thing will go up and down until there�s sports and we get earnings based off those sports. Until then buy/sell all ya can What to do with these DKNG 45c 6/5 hmm I followed unusual activity on 6/12. Feeling a random huge rip. DOCU is beasting, I think its gonna gap up tonight as well, also Ruger and Smith/Wesson 40c 6/19 realistic for VTIQ? [https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1267822500412485638?s=19](https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1267822500412485638?s=19) only thing i got > you wouldn�t be able to buy 400k https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gv4nuh/daily_discussion_thread_for_june_02_2020/fsmzmhh/ Running out of tech/cloud plays. Whats a hidden one Me too, I�m holding a 6/5 $310 call Cmon DKNG give me another run so I can get out of my 6/5s for a decent price. They had a bad news release on Friday after-hours. I'm thinking this stock falls pretty hard the next few weeks. I have put spreads for 6/5, but it won't be highly profitable it appears. Sold 6/19 40P I have 230 6/19 calls holding 6/5 35c 6/10 307c for me. Hoping to unload it Thursday or Friday for a fat knot. My dad is a financial advisor/broker and his advice has always been never sell/buy before 10:30. This has been my only rule that I actually follow (for the most part) and it�s treated me well so far. Keeps me from panic selling and also missing out on possible profits. https://youtu.be/SVyLlFezj2E DKNG bagholders anthem https://youtu.be/CEVdca9U9LM Just buy 06/03 calls and 06/05 puts in equal dollar value and watch the money comfortably roll in. My wife bought 50 calls for NOK 5C 6/26 a week ago as her very first option play. I laughed at her....She is still asleep now and has no idea. I own calls/stocks as well as some puts for hedging, and I can honestly say this market is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life. This isn't investing, it's straight up greed/corruption. I know half this sub has a hard on for Jerome, but that prick needs to be locked up for life. This is destroying future generations, and anyone who isn't into equities. You thought a million dollar home was expensive? Try 3 million once the economy actually gets going again. Market cycles are healthy, this shit needs to stop. Same here. 25k in equity on 6/19 calls. Today hurt. the bid/ask spread on VTIQ is criminal . someone pump thjis God speed. mine are in 6/5. Not feeling too good So I am restarting the wheel but this time at the beginning of the process as I understand it. I sold a CSP on AMC at $5.50 for a $30.00 for 06/12. I am expecting it to not drop much below $5.50 in the near future with movies coming back and Amazon interested in a buyout /r/investing /r/investing Wasting your time w/ spy puts. They are going to try and keep stringing it along as long as they can, grasping for straws of bs news. You might as well wait on puts until after they decide to fuck over retail and sell everything, which will inevitably happen. i have calls ending 6/5 7/17 ba 200 c just bought some 7/17 and 1/2021 calls! super cheap Just get out now dude, the risk/reward makes 0 sense. It's a meme stock with no actual product line on the roads yet and meme valuations and has climbed like 50% on absolutely nothing but merger hype. This stock is if Rivian was a stock. Me and my 7/17 DKNG calls are chillin. 7/17 40c Yea c'mon MU. What are you doing? :/ I grabbed a 200p 7/17. Going naked is giving me anxiety though. I think this run up was way too big a la NVDA Everyone talks about NOK when it comes to 5G but nothing about ERIC. I see two good options, what is making NOK more appealing? (also bought some $5 7/17c earlier, just curious why ERIC isn�t talked about) what to do with penn 6/5 33c i�m down 50% ea c'mon MU. What are you doing? :/"
