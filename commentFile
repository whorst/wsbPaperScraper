$AAPL 06/12 CALLS &1000

Dear Daddy J Pow, if you kindly wait to turn on your brrr machine and let me get out of my SPY 3/12 $300 puts for a minimal loss I PROMISE I will never be a gay bear again and will go all in on DKNG.

Anyone else holding 6/19 MGM calls?

What VTIQ/DKNG plays do you see?

Anyone know why the US dollar is dropping so much in value?  The USD / CAD value has been PLUMMETING the last week

Why arent you playing cloud/tech earnings?

Failed economic system held up by a central planner like in USSR


https://twitter.com/carlquintanilla/status/1267798671636205568

Are you expecting $ZM to fall on earnings? Wondering if I�m reading this right. This is my opinion, but haven�t seen much/anyone sharing

6/19 DKNG 60c

alright last chance to hop all aboard $GWRE train, Cloud SaaS for property / casualty insurance; LOADS OF NEW CONTRACTS for their cloud services. gonna be $115 before earnings

im holding all of my june/july/august/november/januarys until expiry

Gilead I'm so sad ;(

Canada's doing all the same shit though, government handouts are 2k/month for anyone qualified(basically everyone)

nhl still ironing out dates/details as well, but is committed to a tourney

yea i posted the below while i couldnt sleep. also, taking a bigger position than original 1000-1500....


 "Gonna short ZM tomorrow. Probably July puts 205 strike. PE is 2300, that�s fucking crazy. I think people will take profits before earnings too. They�ve reported a user increase of roughly what, 300 million users? Wrong, they came out and corrected that it�s 300 million active meetings daily not users. They haven�t provided a daily user count. MS teams, just for reference, has 75 mil Daily active users, barons article somewhere (too lazy to look up source rn). Fuck zoom, not buying the hype. Even if I�m wrong, a 205 strike on my puts will put me in a position to sell for a either a small loss or break even on next correction/sector rotation and I�m only going to take a 1000-1500 position"

7/19 25c

Here�s hoping. I�m 160c 7/17. Been hearing rumblings about the recertification flight end of month or next month.  Results and approva probably won�t be for awhile

Anyone else besides me still have 6/5 300 Spy Puts? already down $2,500

Had a 850c/870c 6/5s, sold the 850c at 880. Sucks and couldve made more but still got the other

I was gonna pick up some July 17th 20/25 calls today and hold those bitches. But I�m actually a level 5 autist so

fuck my 40c 5/30 expired worthless.....

DKNG gang we absolutely hold through Thursday at least right?

I have 6/12 and 6/19 calls

I think I will at this point, Ive had 06/05 40c for almost a month now. Finally printing, and think Im getting out.

Plundering/looting the entire world, calling it the golden century. Just Dutch things.

[Haha!](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qjfNkapaUZI/maxresdefault.jpg)

6/3 303. Down 8%

I love Coops , here's a nice 1 bedroom $90k , oh btw maint fee is $1400/month.

Yeah it's a ridiculous 6/5

I've finally switched from being a bear.

SPY $400 12/31

Been bagholding GSX $30 6/19 puts for a month now and my ass is grass

pretty sure, $GWRE is a Cloud SAAS company for property / casualty insurance. if you do a google search for "Guidewire" you'll receive alot of results of new partnerships from a multitude of insurance companies throughout the states. Expectations are low, and if the cloud-sect kills it, then investors will believe in forward share prices

6/5 303 gonna hold for a dump. It always happens suddenly

Fucking SPY. It's down at night when cops are being rammed by suburbans and fighting pitched gun battles at night. Only to rise back up with the sun.

https://twitter.com/MTDonnell/status/1267698391892611075?s=20

TSLA about to be green in premarket boys, buy those $1000 6/5 calls

AAXN up 20% since Thursday. Tazer company and body cams. Missed play :/

[This chart](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) looks strikingly like VIX. Correlation doesn't mean causation. However, I would not be surprised in the next few days to week changes in VIX do correlate to changes in new covid-19 cases per day or .... perhaps, to new deaths more specifically which will be about 21 days out.

If it becomes apparent there is correlation, then it will be safe to buy puts . Otherwise, it is gambling.

Seems like they�re about to go on an absolute blitz with investor conferences starting Thursday as well 


https://finance.yahoo.com/news/guidewire-software-present-upcoming-investor-201500754.html

scared to jump in to vtiq at open as i see this 50/50 diving hard and fast or soaring at the open bell

I got 7/1 SPY puts yesterday. $300 strikes. Hope that wasn�t stupid

My iron condor's $308 6/3 call leg is uncomfortably close, might cut some profits to move it higher.

To �invest�, you would have had to trade via shady platforms like [MtGOX](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox). 

Most of the coins generated back then were by hobbyists who subsequently lost their wallet keys. I was one of them.

>YEXT 

 [https://www.yext.co.uk/customers/](https://www.yext.co.uk/customers/) 

literally ALL customers have being heavily impacted by the virus..

I got some 6/5 300 puts at open yesterday... THOSE were stupid :/

FUUUUUKKKKKK all my puts expire 6/19

Pretty pumped to just blindly throw a dart at two names you people have been talking about and having them hit.

CRWD / FSLY

Just buy calls. Its that easy

870c 6/5, and 980c 6/12 bought at close yesterday

Take your initial invested amount out and ride the rest further? That's about 2/3 what you started with so still good upside.

I have CLDR calls ($20c 1/15/21) that are up 165%.  

Should I hold through earnings or GTFO now?

They loose value quickly in the last 2 weeks. Your strategy will only work if it keeps rising. If FB fucks around for a few days as people take profit etc, u get fucked by theta. 

Use weeklies / 2weeks options for daytrading or earning run-ups only.

Now is the time to hop on the Bae Bus

AMD 7/17 $60c
AMD 10/16 $70c

7/17 40c 8/21 50c

Ahhh finally. Another trading day with 1/3 average volume

Im not scared with my shorted SPY 6/3 313c

might sell my $30 call 6/19 once it hits 40.. idk yet depends how much it�s moving

Possible warning to anyone currently shorting GSX. Might be some short term pain. Might be good for short term calls as well.

https://twitter.com/InsideOptions_/status/1267797493816782849

Dude what date/day did you pick up calls?

The 6/19 40C seem to be popular, good delta and low theta.

JCP $1c 1/21/21

Work may pull back if ZM misses/drops on their earnings tonight.  I doubt it, because this market is literally just an elevator that only goes up.  May have a day where it goes down 1% or sideways, but the next day back up we go.

I'm heavy on calls on both, but I'm also insanely heavy on ITM calls for SQQQ because this all feels so damn fake.

I hate holding through earnings but I dont see how CRWD could miss/disappoint. I am planning on holding through.

What is the best strike and expiry you think? I'm hoping you know what's up and it's gonna be like a 10 bagger this month lmao, I didn't listen to the insider info ZS guy so I'm hoping this makes up for it if I put a 3rd of my portfolio into 6/19 calls

Is it too late to move on gun/taser stocks today? which ones look good?

AAXN $105 Call 9/18

Get in on AAXN. Buy shares or calls 2 months out. People feel safer when cops wear cameras (even if they �malfunction� occasionally), and after all of this, police body cams will became mandatory. Here�s your proof (check out 1:12:02 of the Phoenix protests from Friday night):

https://youtu.be/J2mZfpk5rSM

AAXN will be a meme stock by August. You�re welcome.

BA 7/17 230c lets gooooo

�Over the long run�

r/investing is that way loser.

Last Wednesday when tech dipped due to rotation out of the sector.

5/27

that's solid! would you consider doing a quarterly DD reflection? to evaluate your winners/lossers

Oh shit, alright, I'll buy 6/19 5c and 7/17 6c and hope they print

$GWRE - 7/17 $115 calls

Cloud-SaaS for property / casualty insurance, a whole bunch of contracts were signed for $GWRE. Their forward looking growth is in their cloud department. They also have a whole slew of investor conferences are slated for next week, 3 in one week!

Profit taking is survival. Lean hogs futures (/HEN20) get slaughtered.

I had 30 CLDR 6/5 10c I bought last month for $.25 a contract, I sold them for $.2 a contract because I thought that much of a run up was beyond retarded.

6/5 200p is 12. And no. But will join in the mass cry if it does drop after er.

Should I double down on my zoom puts expiring 6/5?

Haha J/K, to think I would listen to you guys again lol.

The upward swing from all the people infected from reopening starting memorial day weekend starts today. [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)

Should have grabbed more 7/17 calls

Heading my portfolio with W / ZM puts. If market is good they have a reason to go down, if market is bad they go down. If market is good my portfolio is safe.

2500 P/E

profit = profit?

i had 5/30 $WORK 40c. They expired worthless. Being early and being wrong arent much different.

Anyone here know a workaround for real time options quotes? Already paying �160 per month for real time nasdaq/London stock exchange/NYSE & deutsche b�rse tickers would rather not increase fees unless necessary

ZS taking a shit premarket, dump? I have 6/5 115C

pretty sure I'm opening atleast -40%, i went all in on vxx calls 6/5

imagine if you followed me on my $DOCU 7/17 $190 call play, you would have a 8-bagger this morning LMAO

Gooooood morning wallstreetbets! 

The sun is shining, the cities are burning, Elon's off Twitter, and the 'tards and 'tists are out in full force, looking for a lil tendie action.

The bulls are looking like the Jordan team in the 90's if Jerry Krause didnt fuck everything up, a historic run that literal anarchy and countrywide chaos cant seem to even put a dent in. The bears....well you know, shambles and whatnot. But in this market, anything can happen! except for red days i guess.

So grab your torches and pitchforks, a heavy brick, and lets loot this bitch until we see justice for u/cpttonystark

damn straight DIS 120c 7/17 fuck me

can't believe my meme china NIO 6/19 4.5c might actually print. opened up weekly puts on MRNA, looking for that to melt down. watching these BABA weekly 205c blow up. it's good to have finally unlocked the green theme

Anyone have any opinion if I should hold my ZS 6/5 115C

Just bought in the DKNG dip for 6/12 and 6/19. Hopefully it works out.

Sold my calls, 305p 6/15 is my new best friend

Because you invested in a company with a 900 P/E ratio and a fucking 30 billion dollar market cap you absolute fucking idiot

6/3 i hope

I dunno.   Not really familiar with the Coop thing, but it sounds like a bad deal.

I'd hate to say it, but single-home is almost always the way to go.  Our system rewards it.  I'd look at how much the monthly cost of a condo/coop works out vs how much the extra monthly mortgage payment would be on a single home, and remember you also get a tax break on that mortgage interest.

But you're not wrong, you almost never really "own" anything.  Just try not to pay property tax and see what happens.

It sucks.  Re prices would drive me to riot if I lived in those costal cities..  I moved to Austin, so I could survive.

Chill. VTIQ ticker changes in a couple days and vote is at 10/11.

ZM bear call spread 240/245

If your bearish right now. Your gay. Also fuck you. I spent 5k on $1000 6/5 calls tsla calls

they aren't even trying to hide it anymore. stonk only go up.

spy 330 6/19c

DIS 110P 7/2 for 2.00

For anyone curious as to why The Fed decided to fuck your $HYG or $JNK puts starting on April 9, it's because the guy running the Treasury is heavily invested in junk bonds:

Hopefully my 6/12�s are safe

Anyone with DKNG puts?  Holding 6/12 40p...

Until the police start dropping bombs like in '85 or burn down Tulsa like 1921 we are a long way from worst:
https://daily.jstor.org/the-devastation-of-black-wall-street/

VSTO 8/21 $12.50c.  As instability drives short-term sales of firearms, fears of armed conflict will transition demand for firearms to ammo stockpiling, which will continue as we draw closer to the presidential election due to media hype around a non-peacful transfer of power.

Anyone else�s company on a hiring/CAPEX freeze?

I prefer safer to July $110/$115 or $120 for the yolo

new strategy. At the close on M/W/F tradings days open a put credit spread on SPX for the two nearest strikes that expire on the next M/W/F trading day.  From looking at historical SPX data this could be promising.

Been holding a VTIQ debut spread for about a month. October 30c/40c. Just closed it for a 100 percent return. The crazy wide bid ask spreads make it difficult to get the best price. Glad to take it

The volume just makes me nervous

I had a 49c 6/12 I was sitting on and sold this morning for 1.6, didn't notice until after I sold that it had *one* volume lmao

You have been chosen to buy the DKNG dip. 

&#x200B;

50c 6/19


1. If I put $100k cash into my IB account, I can buy $400k of S&P500?

2. I'd get liquidated if SPY loses more than 25% of its value `400k*0.25`? 

3. I had this idea. I can buy an asset for free by using the difference between cost of borrowing loan (1.5%) and return of the stonk market (7.5%). 6% of $300K = $18K/yr. Its free money (as long as FED printers run). No?

4. Not sure what asset would make sense to buy though

Too late for SWBI 6/19 20C?

hey look at me i'm a bear

i'm going to bleed 9/10 of my money away over the course of the year so i can brag about doubling what remains of my account once every decade

We haven�t even had any sports announcements yet this thing will go up and down until there�s sports and we get earnings based off those sports. Until then buy/sell all ya can

What to do with these DKNG 45c 6/5 hmm

I followed unusual activity on 6/12.  Feeling a random huge rip.

Cmon DKNG give me another run so I can get out of my 6/5s for a decent price.

They had a bad news release on Friday after-hours. I'm thinking this stock falls pretty hard the next few weeks. I have put spreads for 6/5, but it won't be highly profitable it appears.

Sold 6/19 40P

I have 230 6/19 calls holding

6/5 35c

6/10 307c for me. Hoping to unload it Thursday or Friday for a fat knot.

My dad is a financial advisor/broker and his advice has always been never sell/buy before 10:30. This has been my only rule that I actually follow (for the most part) and it�s treated me well so far. Keeps me from panic selling and also missing out on possible profits.

Just buy 06/03 calls and 06/05 puts in equal dollar value and watch the money comfortably roll in.

My wife bought 50 calls for NOK 5C 6/26 a week ago as her very first option play.

I laughed at her....She is still asleep now and has no idea.

I own calls/stocks as well as some puts for hedging, and I can honestly say this market is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life. This isn't investing, it's straight up greed/corruption. I know half this sub has a hard on for Jerome, but that prick needs to be locked up for life. This is destroying future generations, and anyone who isn't into equities. You thought a million dollar home was expensive? Try 3 million once the economy actually gets going again. Market cycles are healthy, this shit needs to stop.

Same here. 25k in equity on 6/19 calls. Today hurt.

the bid/ask spread on VTIQ is criminal . someone pump thjis

God speed. mine are in 6/5. Not feeling too good

So I am restarting the wheel but this time at the beginning of the process as I understand it. I sold a CSP on AMC at $5.50 for a $30.00 for 06/12. I am expecting it to not drop much below $5.50 in the near future with movies coming back and Amazon interested in a buyout

Wasting your time w/ spy puts. They are going to try and keep stringing it along as long as they can, grasping for straws of bs news.   


You might as well wait on puts until after they decide to fuck over retail and sell everything, which will inevitably happen.

i have calls ending 6/5

7/17 ba 200 c

just bought some 7/17 and 1/2021 calls! super cheap

Just get out now dude, the risk/reward makes 0 sense. It's a meme stock with no actual product line on the roads yet and meme valuations and has climbed like 50% on absolutely nothing but merger hype. This stock is if Rivian was a stock.

Me and my 7/17 DKNG calls are chillin.

7/17 40c

Yea c'mon MU. What are you doing? :/

I grabbed a 200p 7/17.    Going naked is giving me anxiety though. I think this run up was way too big a la NVDA

Everyone talks about NOK when it comes to 5G but nothing about ERIC. I see two good options, what is making NOK more appealing? (also bought some $5 7/17c earlier, just curious why ERIC isn�t talked about)

what to do with penn 6/5 33c i�m down 50%

RIP 6/5 TSLA calls

Learn from these experiences/events I guess. 

There is this book 'laughing at wall street' which sort of describes this mindset. Haven't read it myself (yet).

$VTIQ is voting in 10 minutes to merge with Nikola Motors. They make hydrogen and hydrogen/ev Semi trucks for the trucking industry. This is electrification, this is the way of the future. There is no �pump and dump�.

7/2 $50c wtf goin on?

This might be a retard question - but can someone explain to me why the bid/ask is higher on TOS than RH for the same strike/exp?

lol I stayed out of the ZM puts since they were too expensive but even w/ the pullback the $200p is down. I'm not sure how you guys do it.

Found this online. They have hearing scheduled for wednesday through friday of this week. Not sure about future dates

Hitting the low for the day and I'm still up 20% on my 6/19 45c and 6/19 50c take from that what you will

Anyone kind of bored with life in this timeline? (Not depressed) This pandemic and riot shit sucks. My city has a curfew and it�s absolutely gorgeous out. Can�t get my hair cut, can�t go on trips, etc. 

I just get up, work, trade a bit, exercise and work on hobbies/interests. Feel like there�s a glass wall infront of me and I can see good shit on the other side - just can�t touch it.

For anyone looking for news on PCG here is the website that allows you to follow along with the current trial and see planned hearing dates.

If you grab puts get the quarterly 9/30s and don�t go too deep OTM.

It�s the advice I�ve been giving and it�s kept me in the game. Euphoria can last a long time and it�s in full swing right now.

6/12

DKNG diamond hands engaged. 50/50 either it shakes off the paper hands or creates some loss porn

Do I give up my Wayfair puts right now? 6/19 expiration and getting hammered today. Down 50% all time

Why is nobody talking about CPB earnings?

How could they not destroy with their whole line selling out at grocery stores for months?

$CPB 6/5 55c All In

People aren't looking out long term. The fact that people keep saying the market is forward looking is the opposite of what the market is doing.   


Forward looking would see that GDP is going to plummet. Jobs aren't coming back. More layoffs will happen. 2nd wave of covid in the fall/winter will be worse than the first with many more carriers.   


Nothing is going to get better anytime soon, but that's how the market is reacting. I'm not playing the game. If you want to, you can make short term gains, but reality will eventually set in and the path to recovery will be multiple years long.

Stfu man 
Spy 315 6/30

Ah was it? Got on here it�s expected 6/3.

Yup. I�m mainly long term but I sold most of my long term positions that made tax sense and I�m 90% in the SPY/DIA/QQQ just because if we every have a repeat of March, I want that sweet sweet 24/5 trading

Same :/

Based on the bid/ask. Just means people aren't changing their offer prices because they don't think the dip means anything

I�m into it too. 6/12 55.50 C and 6/19 60 C.

Have been for a week.

Odds of DKNG to $50 by Thursday/Friday?

Here is a fun test:

When you think it�s the right time to buy/sell, don�t. Wait an hour and then buy/sell. Record whether you were better or worse off. Everyone is different, but for me in 8/10 cases I was better off waiting.

DKNG 46c 6/5 contracts .80, free tendies within the hour.

Well as of now bitcoin has little underlying technical value and isn't a currency. Ethereum has promise because the backbone technology that its built on (blockchain) is revolutionizing record keeping and transaction speed/documentation. It may never become a full currency, but it may have other uses (according to experts, idk really what those are.)

I own both and have broken even during trading over the last 2 years, but I have come to hate bitcoin now lol and would rather exit my position (but I'm in the red).

I wrote some 6/5's 170P's earlier today. IV crush thanks you.

Sorry guys I bought a 6/19 50c for DKNG. Didn�t mean to tank that shit

how is the bid/ask a full $1 more on TOS than RH for Dkng. Wut..am I retard?

Fuck it W out launched 6/12 ATM

Do all of you idiots buy only calls and puts without any hedge.  How are you all so sensitive to a 1/2% drop if that?

Does anyone have any long-term trade / investment play on anything that's undervalued and probably going to pull out of this mess intact? Feel like everyone is just riding the short term waves..

Would over double your money on 6/5 just OTM puts

I sold a 6/26 $39 DKNG covered call. Should I let theta do its thing or buy it back on the large pullback today? 

&#x200B;

Kind of expensive. I like the shares, but I feel like I'm stuck in purgatory for the next month waiting for theta/get my shares assigned.

Grabbed some calls at a lower strike and stil have some 6/5 45 and 6/19 45

P.S.  buy my 6/5 $44 DKNG calls

Aight, I'll be taking a break for a month or so now. My puts will probably expire worthless for tomorrow(SPY $293p). I'll be hanging out with my cat instead. Here's a picture: [https://i.imgur.com/99CIFn1.jpg]

If by some miracle my puts don't expire worthless and SPY takes a giant shit by tomorrow, I'll be happy.

1/21/21 12.5
6/19 50c 
Lets fucking go

Yeah it�s flat out ridiculous, all the DD I�ve done and everything I�ve seen/read points to this being a bubble, but for some reason it just doesn�t die

Oracle reports earnings on 6/19. Calls for the run up still on the cheap. Not sure how earnings will go but plan to be out by then anyway.

Hoping the AMD BOA meeting at 3:00pm brings amd to 55-56 by the end of the week. Grab some 6/5 calls for 54-55 if you like gambling

It�s not even worth it to be anything but net long, or if you�re a bear, invest in defensive/corona/riot stocks.

SPY might as well as be pinned. Vix is low as fuck. Drops are .5 percent at most. 

We�re living in crazy timesS

Unless you have 6/5�s it doesn�t matter what strike you have it�s gonna hit

Buy when the shorters sell this/next week.

I agree with the sentiment, but there�s a difference between a company that has billionaire funding and banks that�ll actually loan money. And a company like NKLA that had to do a sketchy merger just to get on NASDAQ. 

People tend to forget Elon almost went completely broke using his own money to fund Tesla in the early days. VTIQ/NKLA will be funded as long as people buy into the idea, but expect them to do share offerings pretty consistently and will dilute the shares, and it�ll be huge huge fees to banks just to do the offering. Didn�t VTIQ recently just raise 5 mil and had something insane like 5 mil in fees to the underwriter? Can�t really dilute when you have terms like that.

But I have 6/5's :(

I'd say the ERI 50calls look like the top end of a 40/50 spread.

Do you think VTIQ 40C 6/5 is relatively safe?

Strike/date?

You're totally right, volume on 40c and 50c for 7/17 are almost exactly the same

I don�t really like the risk/reward that theta gang offers tbh.

But what is it? Good for my poots?

If you prefer max risk/infinite loss just sell strangles then. If you want cheaper directional plays with less risk but capped gains do vertical debit/credit spreads. Theta gang goes not only both ways but sideways. Stocks, EOD, go to the right 100% of the time.

Yup either way if you�re long a put or call.

Its your own opinion/research which determines what�s too far OTM. If you think it�ll swing that much then go for it.

What I�m saying is don�t be surprised if you guessed the movement but you still lose money due to Vega going down. Remember, the stock also has to drop enough past your strike so you make back the premium you paid.

That�s why I try to stay Vega neutral or simply just sell options. Theta gang for life.

when my calls go up all i can think of is devito

You're right, I'm really close to just buying calls on a gold ETF for like 7/17 and letting it ride with my entire portfolio, I know not safe... but yeah. I'm very bearish as well, trying to make as much as I can before the 2nd leg down, and clearly it's not going super great

What are people's thoughts on target prices for MGM over the next month?  Sitting on $18 calls for 7/12.  I see a lot of estimates have an average price of around $17.50.  Do you consider anything over $18 overpriced?  Do you expect more upside?  The current plan is to hold, but I'm curious what other people are thinking.

puts for me :/ Worst part about it is that I was up 25% on my puts and held like a greedy bastard

Mobs promote risk seeking behavior, Casinos sell risk seeking as a service. 

During the riots they will get a taste of flashing lights, smoke grenades and high risk/reward financial gain. After the riots are quelled people will seek socially acceptable alternatives, like the smoke filled, over stimulating casinos to chase that high they once felt.

Bought $50c DKNG 6/12...down $342. Im holding, it should go back up by eow and probably more early next week to sell off. Right? Right?!!??!

I need TSLA at 1000 before 6/19 and im gucci

How are my DIS 120c 7/17 looking boys?

Preorders =/= sales. Especially when any idiot can go on their site and submit a preorder with no collateral.

Because it didn't drop further and there appears to be 'support' at 32 (which it just hit yesterday), I'm confident it's making a comeback.  Glad I got 6/19.

You're right, for now, I'll just throw the rest of my portfolio in long plays, I kept playing weeklies. I'd always know the direction of industries, and also have good ideas about certain things, but was always just a bit off that cost me big. Like holding puts last week when China tensions were getting heated, really screwed myself, coulda sold for $700 profit, instead -$1400.

I'm going to buy some gold calls because gold is down big today. Probably for like 6/26, just curious if you have any thoughts on that?

Well I don't have any day trades and my QQQ $233c 06/05 is ITM and up 20% so hopefully it stays that way through market open tomorrow

I'm rocking them too. What date? 50 c 7/2 here.

this update was just posted. Looks like merger approved, changeover Thursday coinciding with riding the Nasdaq opening bell

why are you selling?

Hard to say. I'm sitting on a couple 6/12s as well. I usually sell calls on MSFT around 184 since it hits that pretty often.

if you're in it for long term on shares why not yolo a 1/2022 leap? that might be too early but if it dips back to like 120 it would probably be a good play

Have you thought about joining /r/thetagang? That sort of steady profit is what they do. 

Consider looking up kamikazecash thetagang strategies on YouTube

Since FRO's exdividend date is 6/3, if I buy today I should get the dividend right? Tomorrow should also have a drop in price similar to the dividend paid?

Get in while it�s cheap for a 10 bagger

GDP compared to this time last year = -53%

If you're writing right now, $45 6/5c feels safe to me.
If you're buying right now, $50 7/19c feels like it has appropriate risk-reward. It's hard to justifying buying calls when the stock is up like 20% in a week though.

I think that once the merge happens the VTIQ market cap will update to reflect the actual market cap for NKLA, which should be around $15B. I'm not sure if this will cause uncertainty or a sell-off, so i am holding. If I were you, I would take profits, but hold some runners just in case.

Anyone else have friends who are more upset about rioters/looters than they were that it took days for a police officer to be arrested for murder after it was caught on tape? 

This is how you know that the stock market is completely unpredictable. People are too detached from reality. No one likes looting, but you can end the looting by actually fixing the problem causing the protests. 

If we fixed the problem and put an end to the protests the market would probably be back at ath.

We had a pretty good sell off on 5/27 (296 on the SPY).  It ended up recovering after therefore was an excellent dip to buy.

FOMO is out and long holders are out of cash to buy more dips. WIll probably explode back to 43 in the first 3 hours aftermarket. Look at the steady stream of red/green/red/green candles from 11 until now.

I think it�s pretty solid. Commissions start at $0.65 per contract but drop to 0.5 if you make like 30 trades in a quarter. But it doesn�t seem to have as useful time and sales data as ToS (which overall seems to have more in depth tools).

I was thinking of dumping my DKNG calls but nba is going to get announced later this week

$45 6/19

I have never seen a more wretched hive of scum and villany than r/politics

Stonks =/= economy.

Interesting, I�m looking at that and 7/17 75c

Do most of you (hopefully the more experienced traders here) really never hold over night?

Ik volatile times but I have 4 310c for 6/10 and wondering if I should hold till tomorrow. I am in the green so may sell 2 eod

Got 1 dis lotto 120c 6/5 holding till exp worthless or prints

praying for my 7/17

Hold or sell DKNG 6/12 $43c ?

7/17 190s. I�m not retarded enough for weeklys

Short term play: B$180p / S$175p debit spread, 6/5 exp.  I'll bail out tomorrow if I'm wrong, but I think it's way over-valued.  And how do things that are way over-valued get pulled back to reality?  Two words: info mation.  And when do we get info on stonks?  Earnings calls, which for ZM is tonight after market close.

If I'm losing money on a call should I sell and rebuy at a lower strike or would holding be a better decision? MSFT 175c 6/19

Might sell the $40 7/17 call @ 5.5

im holding. 6/12 $42c

if wsb shorts dkng, that's pretty bullish imo 50c 7/17

1/21/21 12.5 and 6/19 50

The volume on 6/5 TSLA 1000c's is massive LMAO

https://imgur.com/P7hSuza

Ya'll we need to start a WSB Super PAC.  Get all these idiots off the streets and trading stocks.  Our platform:  abolish the PDT, 1% tax on short term capital gains, and unlimited yearly capital losses above the line deduction.     

VOTE ME FOR RPEZZY!   Spy 400 1/21

How cheap? Cause DFEN is around 13/share and has high premiums since it's heavily moved by Boeing.

Someone convince me why it's a bad idea to open a lot of $5/$7 PCS's on FIT out until Jan 2022.  


Surely this merger will eventually happen and the $50 I got per $200 collateral will be free.

Funny because I've always won on BA... but literally cursed on TSLA

every TSLA position has gone to 0... the two times I would've won big I got fucked (once by RH failing and not submitting my orders, the other time when the space launch got scrubbed and my 880/900 spread expired on Friday)

Don�t hate it. I will buy some tomorrow if it pops up. Prob same expiry as you, 7/17

320x ZM $105 puts for 6/5

I�m gonna hold my 7/17 45c... one red day..

In for some 6/5 115 DIS puts. The word puts is so fucking gay what the fuck

Not as exciting as some of the meme stocks, but I bought options for THO. Nice small upwards movement everyday until earnings next week. I like this DD too: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gtqges/thor\_industries\_tho\_short\_squeeze\_earnings\_68/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gtqges/thor_industries_tho_short_squeeze_earnings_68/)

fuckk no im all in since 35, big 40c 6/5 as well

I don't really day trade and found the more positions I have the worse it tends to be. Try to now focus on 2/3 positions at a time

holy shit, it's almost 2. time is flying by at work. love it. and i'm installing Battlefield hardline so when I get home I can play cops / protestors. shoutout to whichever redditor suggested it

Not if you have calls.


But if your calls are 7/17+ you will be fine, otherwise you might get an exit point EOD. Lot of orders below $40.

yeah it's tough cause most of these cloud/videoconferencing stocks are in such a bubble right now, a pullback is near inevitible but trying to time immediately even after earnings is a too risky for my ass. We've seen "raising guidance" in ER calls can cause shit to moon even more. good luck to you though

not just pricing in 2030, we are also making the assumption that nothing bad happens / no recessions in the next 10 years lmao

That�s just to crush IV so we can make mad tendies with 3 week puts. Say it with me, $650p 6/26!

Bought in yesterday at $10.70. $11c 6/19

VTIQ shares are 1:1 converted to NKLA shares.

Your VTIQ shares/options will disappear and be replaced with NKLA shares/options.

Big option volume on CSOD 6/19 $45strike calls today. Looking like a possible break out...

UNFI earnings play or is this thing already played out? 

6/19 $25c - Earnings is 6/10 before open, obviously selling before then.

If I learned 1 thing from Calls / Puts ... it�s that YOU CANT BE GREEDY !!

Rarely happens, even on a beat. Like 1/10 beats cause a moon.

BRO. Not even the soup. Look at all the brands under their umbrella. All the good snack shit that people have been stocking up on to be stuck at home. The merger with Snyder-lance is about to pay off since they acquired lots of nut brands and premium chip brands as well!!!

I purposely start the day shitty so i can light fire under my ass and chase it back. 60% of the time. It works every time 

/s

Not much more to say about it haha. Their goal is to get people to join their shitty platform but, I wouldn't be surprised if they run away with the money too.

It was funny when the garbage was trying to teach me about foreign exchange and didn't even know what FX stands for. 

They'll probably show you some picture where they made money then sell you the story of living good. When that doesn't work, they talk about some sad shit and how they're in debt. 

This is one of the places they are pushing:  [https://pitradingfx.com/](https://pitradingfx.com/)  Red flags are pretty apparent all throughout.

Or is my client just bugged out

Usually best to wait till mid/end day

Seems like a sell the news event,  anyone is paying attention is assuming they are restarting on 7/31

Picked up 4 $1000c 6/5 TSLA calls 30 minutes ago.  Hope i didnt piss that $800 away

I would sell. That may drop anytime. For sure Japan may start the drop, they have railed since May 22. And Nikkei future is just 1000y (4.5%) from this year highs (  [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NIY=F?p=NIY=F&.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NIY=F?p=NIY=F&.tsrc=fin-srch) ), they were only higher in 90s.

My dad is with you, he bought PINS at like $35/share last year

Thoughts on DIS?? 6/19 $125c looks pretty crunchy right now, but the mouse has burned me before...

I�m willing to die on this ship. 6/12 50c

I know old Will Meade gets shit on but that 950/1000 bull call spread for 6/5 TSLA doesn't seem like a bad idea. Got a few cause why not.

They want you to dump your zoom puts... but they're priced like the bottom is going to fall out. but it's pumping a tad. hmmm.... I have 20x 06/19 160p. I'm not selling a single fucking one until EOD tomorrow.

Nothing, I�m just retarded


https://imgur.com/a/LinM1xt

I feel you lmao.  I noticed the volume/spikes happening so I just grabbed on honestly to see what happens over night or tomorrow.  Can easily make several hundred percent on it if TSLA has one of the standard massive gap ups here

I really wanna gamble on it b/c they�re not at their ATH yet

Hey guys, it�s r/pussies instead of r/investing, am I right?  If you call your sub r/investing and all you do is ally savings or vanguard ETFs, I don�t know what to say.

Opinions on FDX 7/2 $150 or $155c?

FedEx is still low off it�s highs by more than most and should be benefitting from the pick up in e-commerce I would think.

I have said it a couple times now and I don�t think many people read it, but Michael�s (MIK) calls are a solid play,  any $5 calls are going to print real soon, up to 4.53 today, I personally suggest grabbing calls now/soon before it hits 5 if you want some easy money.
I have been riding this since it was below 2.5, and I bought jan 2021 2.5 calls which I am holding happily 

Got some july 5 calls today during a dip

Nothing. No numbers. P/E is 700. This isn�t fundamentals. 

This is a gambling website. Going to be legalized and is first, along with FanDuel. 

People hoping for an announcement on sports for an additional pop. 

This is a meme stock currently.

amzn has better liquidity in range of strike, bid/ask on SHOP is too much for my taste and the hold requires just a tad longer

Because TSLA is electric, while NKLA is hybrid (electric / Hydrogen).  

While hydrogen is a clean source of energy, at this particualr point in time, hydrogen is very inefficient when it comes to storing energy.

If you are somone whos looking for stupid WSB comment to yolo a few bucks on.... here is the comment and now is the time.... Spy 302p 06/03 end of day rug pull + gap down in the am because everyone knows were over due (opening green 5 days in a row is healthy right) turn $30 into $100+  each. or loose it all by tomorrow (this is the way) Also i know puts makes me a gay bear... but i switch hit.

I�ve done both, depends what your trade thesis is. 

If you�re going long and/or you have cash lying around and don�t mind tying it up then use shares. No sense paying for IV if you aren�t using it. 

On the other hand if you are expecting a short term move and trying to time it, a smaller dollar valued position in options can be a good way to magnify possible gains and cap your potential losses. That gets into odds of success so plan to win some and lose some.

307p 6/5's look like an easy way to lose money.

Wayfair w/ that day-trade profit taking.

Cuz I have 6/5 45c and I�m salty about today lmao.

I mean DKNG makes sense because sports are coming back. DIS made sense because it�s Disney and they�re opening back up. Bought the BABA/SPY puts before Trumps speech on Friday where he shit on China, they really should have gone down but didn�t. VTIQ has the merger coming up. They all made sense, but the fucking market just does the opposite of what you�d expect.

my positions are red but I'm choosing to close the app and not be a weak handed bitch this afternoon.

Then all at once [they were all withdrawn](https://i.imgur.com/qQQ64gj.png). DKNG free fell to 40 immediately.

Half a minute later [all buy orders were placed back up](https://i.imgur.com/TyjXc3P.png), and DKNG went back to 40.5 - 41 once more

Maybe down.  I sold mine yesterday and decided to wait a bit, but I also noticed someone buying about $75k of 6/19 30p at the ask.  Might be something there.

IQ 100-130: Buying puts and shorting because of fundamentals/valuation and the economy re-opening. Completely overthinking it.

When you eat a sandwich, eat the first half holding it 'right side up' and the second half 'upside down'. Some sandwiches are much better in one orientation, due to placement of meat, cheese, condiments and vegetables. For some of you, this will be an inconsequential tip, for others it might change your life. Either way, try it out, Ive worked in a deli for many years and if there is one thing I know in life it is sandwiches (a side note for veteran sandwich eaters: If you like, you can eat the first half of the first half in the primary orientation and the second half of that first half in the secondary orientation. The second half of the sandwich can then be consumed in the preferred orientation.

Well MP changes all the time.  Open Interest numbers only get updated after the options market closes, so no way to know what the current MP is.  Plus it's not a sure thing at all - lots of times stocks close well below or well above their MP at the option expiry date.  I have a $180/$175 put debit spread, I'll probably sell it tomorrow no matter what happens after the earnings call today.

&#x200B;

you check the dix out? how bout the vix? check the pools bruh shit is bullish AF

Anybody else have spce calls for 06/05?

Eh.... i don't see how it won't get the green light. Nba wants to make money, espn wants to make money, disney owns ESPN and is the NBA largest investor, they own a lot of DKNG and wanna get the goodwill back of people thinking its safe to start lining up again for their parks. 

Nba is basically advertising at this point that its safe to go back AND you get to maybe catch a game from your favorite teams all from one location?

This much good stuff going for it I'd be very sad and broke if it doesn't pan out this way.

DKNG 6/19 CALLS

Theres been longer days of profit taking/sell off undoing 1-3 days of prior gains, then huge gaps up establishing new lower resistances for the next round of profit taking since april.

[lmao wtf is this shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abLbzW6R_8c)

[like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCMsf5Vn-10)

Hype will build next few days. I�m holding 6/19

I think yes, weirdly hasn't had a run-up at all. It was directly following PENN for the entire crash/recovery and just stopped

1/21 $10p on DKNG. Retarted or cool?

I recommend EURN for the divvies but tanker gang has been getting bombarded with weird ass off-base bearish articles, I don't think it sticks. Tankers thrive off chaos. Gotta be long, shares are the wave, I'm looking to buy if STNG can hit 15 for me like a good little girl.   


EURN the top dog though. You also have an hour to get in on FRO for its 0.70 divvies. A 6/19 7p and shares on FRO is a good move right now.

Well my 17.5 6/09

the vix is down almost 4% indicative of buying and more confidence that can be found on all trading platforms or financial sites. I also read the options pools on ToS

I did say that, it was a random call, based on what the dix/vix has produced in swings

ive lost on puts too bruh, not as bad as you clearly.

Honestly I�ll take some theta burn losses over a gap up.

Does the presence of more retail buyers cause price to rise simply because they use market orders instead of limit below the ask? Like you could have steady buy/sell volume, but the buyers constantly pay "too much"?

Could be great or terrible. How are they going to monetize a video chatting platform which is 99% free? Esp with schools / colleges being off soon and maybe opening up next year. Likewise could go the otherway. idk

SPY JUN 6/5 310/300 put spreadzzzz...so bored why not

My brain might be slightly smoother -- I have missed out on the entire run-up of DKNG thinking it couldn't keep going/ premiums were too high, and then yesterday I bought in at what I believe was its peak for some unknown FOMO reason. 

Only redeeming grace is I put the expiration date out in July so I hopefully have some time for it to head back up.

lol no i chose a poor colloquialism. i am 100000% bullish on these motherfuckers, loaded for bear meant im loaded up heavy on calls on those dates. strikes are all 40, and i added some 6/26s because i have a feeling this is going to pop like a motherfucker when the boomers get on board

Bought 6/5 180p for ZOOM 

Let�s get it

Yup! Pretty common on tankers in my opinion; for example, DHT had a 10% dump May 18th, the day you could get out of it but keep the div. Same should happen to FRO tomorrow, so I'm buying common for the div and puts for the dump. Not as sexy as the yolos but solid way to generate cash.   


0.70 dividend payout should give FRO a -10-15% day tomorrow, but between the puts and the dividend it shouldn't even matter. FRO 6/18 7p is 0.15 a contract right now.

So I have some slight DD/Insider info...

AMD and IBM is all I�ll say. Not sure on dates or prices.  

Apparently, IBM is going to be using only AMD procs in their servers. Not sure when they�ll put that info out there. 

But there you go retards.

Didn't have the balls to hold through ER, sold yesterday. Had a mixture of  7/17  and 9/18 calls at 5 and 7.5 respectively. Clipped the small gains I had. Vegas didn't reopen in time... but I have kinda been regretting my decision a little today....

The higher the P/E the better. Just look at zoom

QuestDiagnostics is a solid company with decent volume that had a big jump today. They didn�t do well with the first Covid wave because volume for other testing was down, Covid testing wasn�t widely available, and patients weren�t going in for other reasons.

With the riots, and things opening up, Covid testing available, and people returning to hospitals and labs for other reasons, DGX should see more revenue. Their fundamentals are solid too, earnings 7/21.

I�m sick of meme stocks. Gonna try 125c 6/19, get in before everything�s priced in.

Can confirm. Bought calls a couple weeks ago for 6/19 and 7/17. Still up 100%+

Did you buy because of the absolutely insane volume too? Last I looked 85c 6/12 was like fucking 20k vol and 22k oi

These are my worst performing equities. What should I sell to get my cost-basis back ?

Sold 210/215 call spread and will sleep peacefully.

Why do I feel like ZM 6/5 170p would be a good play right now for earnings today? Hmmm....

Docusign calls should be a good earnings play. They�ve got earnings on 6/4

Large orders for SPY 214P 12/18

Squeeze out lower 290's puts for 6/3

Jumped on the last minute ZM 125P 6/19s. Let�s hope the massive run up for earnings finally sells off.

LMAO, I don't know if it is true but seems like 4chan has trolled Trump with half naked anime girls:

Odds on my spy $314C 6/22 expiring in the money?

NIO $5p 6/19 bought at eod to hold overnight

6/5 300c is not a lotto? okay sir whatever you say..

I got 6/5 170p lotto

Easy money in the last 20 mins 6/12 310c in for 2.76 out for 3.19, sold a touch early but aint mad

sold two ZM 150p/290c strangles for .55. let's hope these are safe.

I sold my 6/5 SPY 310c @ 2:44 before the huge green candle. You�re welcome.

Picked up a 6/25 305p just in case/for morning dip

i got a 180 p @ 206 Strike 6/5

&#x200B;

Ja Bless

I broke almost exactly even between calls/puts/stonks today. 

I lost 1.31. 

I call that a win.

welp stay safe during your next martin looter king night american bulls/bears and don't let the theta tards tickle your anus

Can�t believe my most successful trade is buying LK at the bottom. Invert WSB, but invert /r/investing even more. I got downvoted hard over there after a fucking 70% bump up lmao. 

Fucking Boomer retards.

im betting we blast past ATH by august and then come crashing down once infinite QE / stimulus is all gone.

Well it has been since Donnie Dump but /shrug whatcha gonna do?

Here�s a Trump tweet from 2011:

Lol

https://i.imgur.com/59i30xg.jpg

has to be 6/5

I think you're right! When the time is right, I'll take a fat $100K SPY/IWM put position. This market hasn't run out of gas yet though.

I sold my FB 230Cs 6/5 at $2.00 today lmao, bought them at $2.50 to day trade and thought I was wrong and doubted myself......

One day I'll not be a fucking retard, could have made a huge recovery if I just believed in my intuition.

Yes fucking sir 
ZM 6/5 $300c

170p 6/5

https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/065/454/d1d.gif

My real pain starts past 270. 

Sold 2 ZM 270 calls. Also sold 10 ZM 250/270 bear call spreads. And 1 more ZM 270/300 bear call spread.

Check out the 6/3 SPY 311-314 call orders around 12:50, some retard fat fingered FIFTY 312c�s at 1.34 and FIFTY 314c�s at 1.26, when they were worth like .05.

Incoming the nut fest w/ ZM

I bought QQQ 315c 9/30 in January - I think it may print.

ZM has a P/E of 2346


what. the. actual. fuck.

Same but mine is 6/12 308p just at 3:59. will sell that shit right in the morning lol

check out /r/GhanaSaysGoodbye for all put holders

How could have anyone doubted ZM on its way to infinite P/E?

And your fake $40 resistance point clearly corresponds to unit economics of the business and future profitability/market share potential. This is a shit business and I worked on it when it was private

On /ES, out of the last 13 daily candles, 11 of them are green. With the close of today, we're also on a 7 daily green candle streak.

in this market it takes more balls buying calls during a global pandemic/recession/riot/looting/race wars/mandatory curfew

theta is recalculated every tick. 

theta is a function of the bid/ask.

Same here man. I figured the recent good quarter was simply priced in by this point...apparently I was wrong :/

If they�re 6/19 I think they�re going to be fine.  The euphoria wears off quickly even after a stellar ER.

$ZM AHHAHAHAH SOLD 230c 10x for friday at 6/ea

Add a 2% increase per trading day X by trading days from 6/21 shows 26% increase if everything , that would be a good gauge for it.

I am 96.58048% sure that WSBnoobxor is not a bot.

sold a 210/215 lol- but i might get fucked

I did the opposite. Bought the first big dip, doubled down on the the 2nd, and tripled down on the 3rd dip. I sold for a nice profit near EOD, but left some good money on the table by not selling all of them the last 5 minutes. These  were all 6/12s though, I don't blame you for being a little scared of 6/5s.
