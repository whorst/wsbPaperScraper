Thoughts on DKNG 6/19 40c? Been holding since DKNG was at 37

Trying to sleep is so gay, I wish I could just go into my bed and knock out, and only way to do that is to sleep deprive myself, 5:40 AM not sleeping till 4 P.M

The Stages of Reopening (update):

Week 0 - Excitement - "OMG we're back!!"

Week 1 - Euphoria - "SPY 300+, I heard there's lines at some place!! V-shaped recovery!!"

Week 2 - Realization - "hindsight, lockdowns were stupid. Probably caused more harm than it prevented"

Week 3 - Concern - "okay the lines are shorter now, I participated in going out, it was meh.. it was slow and awkward, maybe it comes back?"

- Most of you are here

Week 4 - Growing Concern - "These places are empty... How are they going to make it on 25% capacity, assuming they're even seeing that? No one is getting rehired, in fact they'll probably need to let more go."

- Next week!

Week 5 - Full Bear - "Okay, this is slower than I remember 2009 being. I don't think it's bouncing back. SPY levels totally not sustainable, WTF were we thinking!?!"

Week 6 - Joining the Poors - "I thought my white collar job was safe, but the company is being more dick now than they were when we were under lockdown.  I think they retained people just to cultivate good PR during the crisis, but are ready to release employees"

I lost my ass on SLV in the last month. Might try again in a month or so when SPY hits 400 and tanks are rolling in the streets.

Yeah.  That fat dick green candle triggered when we dropped below 3100 for a second.  Depending on how it moves PM, I think I’m gonna sell my puts

"ECB SEES 2020 GDP GROWTH AT -8.7% IN BASELINE SCENARIO VS +0.8% SEEN IN MARCH"

Been seeing some comments on WeBull saying it won’t be tradeable for 2 days so I took my money to GNUS

Ghetto reversal candle on FTSE 2 hour

sell my SAVE $20C at open or keep holding, the growth in the last 2 days has been insane, and I'm a little worried NGL lol.

Massive in UK, 1 reason why I bought into DKNG hype before

That’s the goal? You keep pushing an hour back till its 8 PM

PLEASE SPY OPEN BELOW 309 ILL BUY CALLS INSTANTLY

If I buy a ton of BA 6/5 190Cs and it dips like 2% how bad will the IV crush be?

I can’t believe I sold my UAL $35c 6/12 because there was a dip of .20. It’s not gonna stop now.

LMK if you find penny options on BA that aren't at a $390 strike

$BUD with that super strength. Where were you when BUD mooned? Literally free money.

6/19c $50

#PLAY HERO ACADEMIA SEASON 2 OPEN SOUNDTRACK

#TIME TO SELL PUTS TODAY YEEE HA

SPY 305 EOD

Tried to buy 100 shares of SPXS yesterday but Fidelity was like "naw bitch first read this" and I was like "fug that"

WTF do I do with these DKNG 7/17 $45c ?

I have $430 in buying power that I wanna withdraw but I also wanna just put it on a FD. Decisions Decisions

Sell my 6/19 ZM puts at open and buy SPY calls?

My brother who works at Walmart and makes like 25k a year won 11k a few weeks ago on an online casino. He then managed to turn that into 18k. He cashed out and went to the actual casino yesterday and walked out with 7k profit. All his big wins were on $2 a spin too. A whole years salary in less than a few weeks. Like wtf am I doing here?? I'm going to Vegas!

Need SAVE to keep running, picked up my first small potatoes option 20c 6/16 yesterday.

AMD just like, I'll chill at 52 and theta burn everyone.

September 18 BA 280C, autistic enough?

Why though

don't tempt me, two days ago someone said buy SPG and I said "Investing in malls sounds like the worst idea ever right now, I'm in"

But I wasn't in

I lied

Surely this can't happen 2 days in a row right

Also happened to me a couple days ago, had 100 shares of WORK, hit my stop loss at $37 then rocketed to $39. Made a whole $9.

I’m all in on MGM NKLA and BA as of 5 minutes before closing bell yesterday. About to open up GREEEEEN

My JETS ETFs were up 20% yesterday from when I bought them 2 months back lol

Yo, everybody with a brain here: (yes, all 5 of you)

This is bad right?

This is the first data we see that the narrative of a V-shaped recovery is not real and that most of the jobs and value we lost, won't be back instantly. 

 Is this the moment where the market starts to find out that fake money doesn't represent value for society? And what is the alternative bullish narrative here?

I turned into a bear a few days ago and trying to understand if I am just very subjective here.

Sell BA 180c 6/5 at open or hold or roll out

BA had a crazy 2 week rally and now everyone expects it to double by September .... c'mon.

For the past 6 months,  it was mostly on decline.

it is buried in debt and declining cashflow. 
Orders getting cancelled. Employees laid off.


**DD: puts for July look better than calls for September**

Holding 50 AMD 52p expiring tomorrow. Really want to get rid of them ASAP.

Yyyyyahh.... 



as depressing as it is to realize, the SPY already tried to make it past **313**, back on March 4 2020. 

&nbsp;


Perhaps that was too soon, and this time, FOMO and irrational madness in general will allow us to rise above 313.

ECB's GDP growth expectations for the Eurozone:    
    
-8.7% in 2020  
+5.2% in 2021  
+ 3.3% in 2022  
  
Meaning no full recovery before 2023.

CRWD 6/5 110c

bought for .60 after seeing Meades tweet

doesnt look so good now

he mentioned RGLY though and its printing

Yyyyeahh....   good morning.....

if it makes u feel any better i sold 3 309 SPY calls 3 days ago because of a little morning dip :/

Shop is at 757 all in on BA

Another 2 million jobless claims; continuing unemployment claims went up. V shaped recovery took a week off.

I really love watching CNBC interview of Dr. Scott Gottlieb

He's been saying the same thing everyday in different ways for the last 3 months.

BUD looks like a good bet

Big boys rotating into value and it just blasted through the only real resistance on the chart at $50, next stop is $58 

I’m in 9/30 55c

Sold DAL $29 calls two days ago at a slight loss because seemed like it was a reach to get there in time.

TTOO for the win!  Wish I owned more than the 10 shares I bought as a joke.

This meme market is so retarded that each stock can have its own movie in the future lol


Zoom : the wrong zoom

Donkey Kong : Fomo made Homo

SPY : always at all time high

Microsoft : 200c 

Tesla : Mission moon

Spce : humans become stonk


Special mention:

J pow the recession Slayer

My Nkla calls showing worth $0 on RH has me sweating

Sell or hold MGM calls at open 19c 6/5 and 20c 6/19

Sell or hold DAL at open 31c 7/17

TWTR puts, currently trading at the top of a bearish channel. If it doesn't crack $36 in the next couple days then back down she goes.

6/19 MGM 21c should I sell or let ride?

Feeling a bit more calm now about having 1/3 of my portfolio in NKLA calls. Could barely sleep last night.

FOMO'd into 100 shares of GNUS. we'll how this ends up.

FUCK I JUST WANT NKLA CALLS. SHITS GOING 40 EOD

Sold my W 180P 6/5 at close yesterday and held onto my TGT 120C  6/5. Looks like I had it completely backwards.

thanks.

guess i’ll use my old gtx 970 with a top of the line CPU until i can get ahold of one. should be interesting

I had an MGM $18 call I sold out for like a 20% gain and was happy with that since it went down after I sold. Imagine if I held =/

Once August rolls around and the 737 MAX is re-certified, BA will moon bigly. Adding more BA leaps on the next dip (if any)

May jump on PFE 7/17 38c today

Thank you lord JPow for giving me the strength to buy 100 shares of BA at $100. Amen.

Not if you get longer dated calls. I've got MGM 8/21 20c that I picked up yesterday morning so idgaf about a couple of red days for a while. Literally no stress for now

New company making electric semi trucks. Production starts in 2021. Something like 10 billion in preorders. They merged with a blank check company (VTIQ) that raised 700 million for them to build their factory and ramp up production. NKLA was not publicly traded prior to the merger.

I predict ES at 3106 - 9:17AM EST

can't trade options for 2 days

Same for WMG I think

Anyone eyeing some SPY $315 FDs?

Was bagholding EBAY 50c till it expired worthless last Friday.. damn

DKNG down to 39 in premarket... I was telling people to short or buy puts! Lets go!

$UAL $35 calls 6/19 bought 6/3 @ 8:35AM. Big money moves.

I posted about ERI last night. It’s not too late to get in right now it just passed the 200 day SMA which should trigger some major technical buying, that plus all of the unusual activity that has been reported on ERI the past month and half makes this a really good bet in my opinion. It’s not too late to get in now, don’t wait for the dip

Need donkey king to hit $50 ASAP

I have $306 FD’s expiring tomorrow.

Bought this SPY 311p yesterday not sure if I should hold

DKNG under 40 = load calls

NIO delivered 3436 EVs. 215.5% more than a year ago.

"It's 5AM and I'm not hearing the printer going BRRR! SAD! JPOW  @ federalreserve  need to pump this dump! THANK YOU!

\-Donald Trump June 4 2020

MGM might even make me brake even after 5 months of suffering

Yeah but I lost 5K playing with SAVE when it was at 10 bucks. So I am a bit afraid of buying it at 20

Hold for Monday. MGM hasn't even opened their full 4 yet.

Not too involved in DOCU like the rest here, but if ZOOM blew earnings out of the park, WORK will too, granted they are modeled differently and ZOOM has a retarded P/E, I don’t know what to expect from WORK earnings.

I have $45c 6/12 and depending on how WORK moves today I’ll choose whether I want to sell them before the ER or not

Should i dump my FB 235c 7/17

Official bull prediction thread:

SPY EOD: 313
DKNG EOD: 41
BA EOD: 195

6 min till open do I sell my 90c for RGR for oct 20?

Man I sure hope these ZM $210 Friday puts works out cuz my account is screeewed.

Lmao I still have 1 packet left over XD

I would go for Aug at least. Took DKNG moon to 40s in almost 2 months

Hookers and blow with 100k 4k on BA 190 6/5

DKNG is doing exactly what SPCE did 4 months ago. Topped 42 because memes and never saw it again. It’s not too last to take this Atlantis style slide all the way back to 10 bucks. If you enjoyed the ride come and enjoy the slide

come on NKLA go to 40 bby

“I thought airlines would pull back following SPY today and sold my stakes in airlines too soon. So mad.”

Read it again. “Following SPY today”.  He’s calling what SPY will do at 840 am with incredibly low volume.  It’s so silly to watch SPY futures these days.

BA calls because shits retarted yo and will be $200 by July for no reason.

buy MGM at open, I see $23 by eow

CZR price target raised to $12 and buy rating maintained. Buy calls and thank me later.

Nah... I think he was just ranting on those type of companies. They all got meme strength in the beginning. They often end up like Virgin Galactic tho. 

I had no idea how spac companies actually worked. I was at least informed. That's the only reason I watch cramer. I learn a few things like that and then lightning round gives me names I haven't heard of that I go and do DD. I skip thru the interviews unless it's something interesting like the CEO of Crowdstrike yesterday. 

I listen to 0 of his stock pick advice. Tho I wish I had listened on a few like SHOP.

ESTC drag to $81 and i'm back in, took my profits a bit back around $90

I got an alternative for you... here it is... wait until 1030 ET and then decide if you want puts or calls

Ok, DOCU u can do it, pump straight past 150 without looking back ok?

Wow GWRE just dumped like $8 of gains at open.

ERI 42 - ERI 42

Wait until Davey Day Trader tells people he longed it.

EBAY WAS MY FIRST OFFICIAL 10 bagger!!!!

Was about to FOMO buy NKLA at 38 and hovering over that buy button thought... let me wait a sec.... awesome.

Well that was yummy.  I started to layer in a short on NKLA at 38, 38.50, and had more at 39 etc but it didn't get that high.  Got filled on 400 shares and then it dropped $4 in 2 minutes.

June 5 SPY 312 and 313 calls literally can't go tit sup

Testing to see if my damn account is old enough to post yet....

&#x200B;

Current positions

GME 6/19 5.50P

AAL 1/21/22 10C

I’m literally so happy to see DKNG green I diamond hands through the last 3 days

BUD train still taking passengers 

Still trading at half of its 52 week high

2 minutes ago I managed to dump 4 NKLA weekly calls @ 2.25, now they're at 0.70. Wild

Fuck man, I didn't buy GNUS at 3.44 2 days ago cause I wanted to research on it first, up 300% since then lol... I aint gonna FOMO in though

wtf BA i sold 1 call this morning for cheap :( still got 1 left though!

just lost 3k on NKLA in 2 mins. yolo'd 10k into SPY 311c expiring tomorrow. this is my last play guys. either I'm eating or it's done. wish me luck I guess

DKNG pls hit 45 today

$41.5 6/12 LUV calls are on sale

Chucked my last $100 in MGM 23c 6/5  


God speed everyone

congrats to BA calls guy; I was thinking about your $160c post yesterday.  hope you held overnight lol

Good fucking god SPR just made me so much fucking money. Bought a stack of 6/19 35c’s mid day yesterday, and just sold for like 700% gains. It will probably still go up, but I just needed to take the win. Great start to the day

Fuck it - joining the BUD train. July 17 65s

Just got into 7/17 $20C for AAL

Anyone ever heard of this really big company that’s still half off that makes almost all the planes and also fighter jets and space rockets and has been around for a 100 years and was founded by the guy that also founded United as well as UTI? Idk it’s also an American company...

TSLA 5 bucks, cmon, chump change, GET IT

FOMO into $200 7/2 BA calls

So should I sell NKLA or hold. Went up 2 grand to down 90 fuck me

You've been visited by the DKNG long green dick. Forward to 50 other gamblers who wish to get tendies or have your basement flooded

TESLA 1000 LETS GO

FUCK BA GO UP PLZ PLZ PLZ 190 PLZ

Argh idk if I should hold my SNE 69.5c 6/12 any further

Sideways helicopter on the NKLA 5 minute. It's so beautiful.

I AM BACK BABY COSTCO all the way. I've been so patient and it's paying off.

Position: 150 calls x 6/19 310

If SPY crosses -0.1%, I'm buying 5k  3/13c 6/12

Y'all buy the hell out of those DAL $31 calls!  I need it to sit at $29-30 for another week.

Looking at Boeing is making me cry. Sold out at $145 and can't decide if it will ever dip from here. Fucking A

Wow RH totally cucked me on NKLA. It's sell option function bugged out. Oh well still sold for $30 profit so I'm not too mad

SPY going to 313 EOD

Feeling like taking a shot at 900 today, TSLA?

gay bears love getting fkd over and over again 
DKNG 6/5 38c

Wtf is up with GNUS?

I bought some yesterday at ~5.7 but then got stopped out almost immediately now it's over $10 damn it. Wanting to hop back in without the stop but seems so risky.

It says VTIQ then when i click into it, it says NKLA 8/21 45c but it’s worth 0 and i can’t trade it

MGM gonna hit 22 by noon

Essentially yes. Noticed that airlines were starting a big rally, even a few days ago, and I took longer than I wanted to get in. But then I saw someone mention SPR and that it basically follows BA to a T given what they do. They also pointed out that last time BA made. Run towards 180+ that SPR followed to about 35. The 6/19 35c’s were .18 yesterday when I bought them lmao. Just sold 1.40, and I think they’re still climbing

MGM is going to be around $27 by the end of the day

Of course I sold DKNG at open and it moons. Held for 2 days of straight red for this shit lmfao

Thanks for the one who said to go in on ETSY! Made 500 bucks with calls.

Just sold out my PWR 06/19 for 1200% 0.02 contract to 0.50 9 contracts

Can you imagine how dumb you are if you didn't just put you entire portfolio on SPY 6/12 320 Calls?

Some autist just bought $5 strike puts expiring next month on MARA for $5.00 a contract.  Pro move to guarantee yourself a loss in every event except breakeven if it drops 100% in a month. 
 Now MARA is a dumpster fire... but do they really expected negative prices?

Moment of silence to the bag holders who didn't unload their NKLA options this morning. You in the back who woke up 10 minutes too late, yeah I'm talking to you too.

Now true investors on the other hand. "Rubs hands together like Italian mob boss"

Everyone shitting themselves about NKLA:  DEAC -> DKNG did the same thing.  Gap up -> red -> gap up -> red -> small gap up -> red, then slow climb.

If you got expiry 2 weeks out, you should be fine.  Otherwise, good time to get in.

In DKNG before merger at $16, out at $22
 
In DKNG at $39, out at $41.20.
 
Will get back in when it hits $35 eventually

NEED YEXT TO HIT 20 Today. Holding 17.5 and 20 calls

Should have bought 1000 LK shares instead of 100 but I have small nuts.

9/18

MGM 25C (up 200% from a few days ago)

WYNN 120C (just bought more)

8/21

SYY 70C (just bought more)

AAL 14 Eod

Lol at Nikola. How many of you who went long had any idea of what you were buying? It looks like a promising company, but wow. A $10 billion valuation on a company that doesn’t expect to deliver products until 2023? Buying into a ticker that after the merger only represented <2% of the company and is expected to be diluted even further to raise capital to execute its business plan? We transitioned almost instantly from believing we were going into a depression to another .com bubble.

AMZN swinging its big dick over $2500 rn

If you had 25 Amazon shares from a cost basis of $400 would you:

A) Pay off your student debt

B) hold that shit forever

Asking for a friend.

will MGM see 21 again

The battle at 36 for PFE is amazing

MGM will see $21 by noon again

hope y'all bought the MGM stock

$22 by noon

MGM @ 22 by noon

I bought the dip

MGM 6/5 $21.50c dumb as fuck or no?

Bought a few SPX 6/12 3150C. Plan is to load up if we drop further.

MGM. I had MGM 6/19 $20c that I sold Tuesday when it dipped. 

So I bought MGM 6/19 $22c

BUY THE MGM DIP

22 BY NOON

You mean the great SPY crash of when it didn't moon to 400 of 2020

Those talking shit about NKLA, well it has been only 20 minutes and it’s doing exactly what rest of market is doing so calm your tits down. We have a long day ahead of us

The KR resistance at 33 is soon to come to an end. Hop on this tendie train while u can boyz

MGM sniffing 30 by late June get in idiots

only the retards didnt buy the MGM dip

22 by noon

Lol 20 minutes into the day 

“FUCK IM BROKE THIS SHIT SUCKS FUCK ME”

If MGM could put in the afterburners to 22 I would greatly appreciate it.

I wouldn't be surprised if BA and SPR traded flat at 180 and 30 respectively today after AH and the spike followed by profit taking this morning

Just remember.

AMD refused to go below 39 in the most dire global crisis of our lifetime.

Bought the obvious dip on $MGM, let's keep riding to 22 bb!

SPY 313c 0DTE LET'S GO BABAYYYY

NDX ripped to ATH from the open, 60 points in 20 minutes

BUY MGM 

22 by noon

6/19 200c BA bought on the dip let's ride

SPT $35 Call for 6/19

guys, I lost 3k on NKLA this morning and YOLO'd 10k into MGM 6/12 21.5 and another 10k into SPY 6/5 311c, either I'm gonna be very happy by the end of the day or I'm going to die a legend. just took a shroom microdose as well (1g). here we go fellas. i don't recommend doing this I'm a fucking retard. proper WSB autist

I bought SPY $310c 6/12 good move or retard move?

And I thought jump on to GNUS train at 8 is too late lol

YEXT going to 20 EOD

DKNG  


Vegas success + Michigan casinos partnership + NBA meeting?  


43 by EOD.

MGM 7/18 $25c

When to get out?

DKNG 45 6/12 C's seem pretty cool and arguably very legal

Need a TSLA green dildo to 900 like I need oxygen

BA 210 C 6/12 looking good

Anybody having trouble with RH today? Sold my 308 puts at about 6:43am order was filled but I haven’t received any buying power, anyone know what’s wrong?

MGM 22 EOD

Should I buy LK calls or is it going to be a "dead dove inside" moment 4 months from now?

RH glitching for anyone else?  7/17 puts showing .01 across the board

Yesterday I bought BA $170 Call for $2.98 and this morning I was planning to sell it at market open for $5.93 surprisingly the option price went up to $12.05. Profits baby!

RH has been a real dick to me if I don't buy spreads through their method instead of buying each leg manually, did you have to put up full collateral for the put you sold or just the $100 to cover possible loss if both get executed?

I don't know the answer to your question either btw, when I do spreads I only do credit spreads and those I know you want to expire worthless

MGM 22 EOD, BUY THE DIPPP

Hold AMD 7/2 calls?

BUYER: TAP 7/17 $45c, TAP 7/17 $47.5c

As if my own garbage portfolio compared to you monkeys making 400% on GNUS isn't enough, I watch financial education to margin my misery. Guy roasts weed stocks for over a year, makes a bullshit video about buying planet 13 on Tues, stock up 30% yesterday. Fucking joke

MGM 22 EOD

how are yall feeling about DOCU? Holding throuh earnings today? Ive got calls expiring tommorow, was up $250 but RH was glitching when I was going to sell now down $120 I can see it running up more before ER AH today though?

The resilience of this market is nuts. SPY can't even stay red for 30 minutes.

Held my 7/17 45c DKNG and just bought 1 6/19 35c on NKLA, lets how these go

Bois, thoughts on JPM 7/17 $110c?

Oh god luckily I'm not the only one, lost 25% of 1900 because I got fking cocky at the ECB rally today, bought calls, panick sold and now the market is again at the same height. 

Really hating myself right now

I was there for the DKNG IPO so I knew how this would go. Watch this cup and handle form and it rocket past 40 by eow.

Am I fucked? 6/12 BA 200c

Any chance $SBUX hits 90 next week? Bought the calls like a month ago

I hope that dude that said  gorilla to 80 EOM is right. So autistic he might just be right

Sold AMZN at breakeven to buy more BA.

*BA executes die maneuver, AMZN 2500 immediately*

PFE January 2021 40c

Looks like it’s gonna flip the script one the last couple trading days pattern.  We were dumping at open and then pumping.  I think we have a power pump to spook the bears, and then we dump.  The dump might not be until next week though.  

SPY 300p 7/17

DKNG 45c activated.

I’m $5,500 away from my self imposed limit for buying myself Red Dead 2 Ultinate for PC. Come on spy

I bought a July 17 BA call cause I guess I haven’t learned not to listen to you all

MGM @ 22 BY EOD

Why is RH telling me I have 0 day trades when I know for a fact I have 2 this week?

Almost another 2 million jobless claims.  VERY bullish. Let's go JPow.

SPY 6/5 307p I feel like such a fag

MGM 22 BY EOD

RH shows me up +700 today but my balance is only about 200 ish dollars up from yesterday. Anybody know why this might be happening

Hope folks scooped up the little MGM dip. 23 EOW seems likely.

I genuinely can’t believe GWRE swung that violently on earnings. 

Whatever, they smashed EPS and they have investor conferences coming up. This is going back to 118 at least hopefully.

Just picked up a bunch of UUP puts for 6/19. Strike is at $26 and UUP is sitting at \~$26.25 right now so I can see it getting in the money in a few weeks. Contracts are cheap too so I got a lot of them for very little. 

The way I see it, with all the printing the FED has been doing, the dollar has to crash, and we are seeing that now. 

Get in on it!

I'm 20c sep MGM we're gonna need a lot of sauce for our tendies

Yeah all in on WORK. 35c 36c and 45c. I think 40c is the best play and they are going to crush earnings.

VXX 6/5 33c not looking good

Dude I'm up 160% in 2 days just buying yolo retard SPY calls...because...fuck who knows.

Cintas CTAS closing in on $300 the fed with banks buying

BAM! 6/19 55C BUD ITM

I've been marked as PDT after a month of dancing just at the edge.  Fucking MGM plays yesterday gave me tendies but fucked me for 90 days.

SMAR 6/19 call is down 94%. Should I sell or hold onto to it, hoping it rises in the next 2 weeks?

PFE 6/12 $38c is looking real tasty

I am up bigly on my CRWD play. I picked up the 6/19 110c when they were .10 a pop

I am just annoyed I strayed away from my strategy and didn’t lock in more gains when they were 3.20 yesterday

Every time a tech stock blows earnings just buy calls a month out. Easiest money in the world.

ESTC $90c 7/17

SPY 450c 6/5

Just get on a different broker, TD or something else for these 90 days

JPOW is our lord and saviour. 3500 SPY incoming

BA 190 EOD GET IN NOW

Dude, I had 1500 shares at 143 I bought on April 29. Literally had to bag hold an entire month before I could get out of my position at even money. Since I got out BA has been green everyday besides one. I am so fucking mad. Wouldve made over 50k if I held for a few more trading days.

MSFT Bouncing off 185 like a god damn wallball in elementary school

Question. Why do you think NKLA will dump? Besides "it went up too fast too quick"

The company has something like $10 billion in preorders for their trucks, including a starting fleet of 800 trucks  from Anhauser Busch.

damn looking like HEXO is going to go way up before i get the money to invest. was going to make it my retirement stock for 10 years when i get a job and then watch it print 10x

Bond market pulls the plug on equities.

10 year yield has spiked more than .1 in 24 hours. Dxy crashing.

GG Mr. Powell, the market is calling horseshit on the US. Ze vigilantes may be back.

Holding DAL 1/21 leaps that are up 100%. Q2 earnings will surely cuck the stock right? Short and take profits now?

Go. Buy. PRIM.  Shares just broke out above the top of the 17.30 channel.  Slow and steady rise over the last two weeks.  A leg up to $20 is coming in the next few days.

So if I do 2 day trades within 5 days I don't get hit with PDT? 

if I do 3 day trades in 5 days I do get hit with PDT and my account is locked?

DOCU has been in every daily thread for like 2 weeks

Why not sell half so that the others are essentially free

I did this with XLE

Bought 20 contracts at 60 cents each

Sold 10 for 1.20.

Now the 10 that i have can ride for free until 2021.

VIX really gonna drop under 25 again, isn't it?

Anyone else get BA 6/5 185c? Praying I don’t get wiped out lol

$15 AAL c 6/26 lets get jt

7/17 $7 c reporting for launch into Kim K butthole

I think it's over 3

RH "Day trade protection" prevents you from doing a 4th day trade, which might get you PDT locked

I'm making a "high conviction" play on AMZN in advance of the 6/22 10 - day sales event. I think the buzz around the event sends the stock up 2600, its consensus price target. Long stock & calls.

Circuit breaker number 2 for GNUS

Cool. Just need dkng to stay above 41 and I'll be happy. Also, gl to everyone playing BA. that'll provide priceless entertainment from the new investors not knowing the fuckery of ba mooning and crashing in a 20 min span

Feel like BA will consolidate today and break over 186 tomorrow

I'm getting really scared

I managed to somehow buy in GNUS at over 11

Help

My CHWY FD of $65C 6/19 is up 252% since I bought it. I'm starting to think this thing might actually end up ITM at this point. No brakes.

CRWD back to $100+ in 2 weeks? Yes or no?

Ughhh this 311 SPY put what to do I wanna get a call

GPS.. seems like the clear play is $12c going into earnings.  Still down $7 YoY

MOMO PRINTING J Morgon $35 price upup

Wow, MSFT bounced off of 186 hard. I expect it to drag to 177 until earnings.

UAL 40c 2022 bought in April

ALL IN BYND calls let’s get it to 140 so close

Get in now before it picks up.  17.5 6/19 C

Why is there 86k people that have 1 HPQ contract?

Just went bigly on 9/18 JETS calls

All you had to do was buy JETS when Buffett said he sold airlines and youd be up 50% right now in 1 month haha

I sold my $CHWY $45c 06/12 and my $BA $180c 06/19 last week (had 2 of each bought at about $1.00 per) 

AMA

Bought TSLA 930 Calls for 6/5 as a yolo play

SPY can't even manage a 20 cent drop...fucking pathetic

should i sell my SHOP 06/12 $800 calls with 40% loss ? 

market is green too many days

Do I hold my DKNG 6/12 $50c into next week for Monday pump or dump it today after NBA vote?

50% in 1 whole month? I’m 45% in 2 days with AMD and 60% in VIX Lol . 50% in a month is cute though . Adorable.

Some brokers still can't buy and CEO going on CNBC in 30 mins. Hold your titties.

JPOW does not let red candle dicks anywhere near this market - we are going for 9 straight green candle dick days today.

#Got $150K all SOLD CASH SECURED PUTS WHEN IT WAS LOW AS FUCK THIS MORNING LETS GO

#PLAY HERO ACADEMIA SEASON 2 OPEN SONG

AAL 7/17 20c

MGM is opening in 45 minutes. Buy the dip before FOMO.

I'll jizz if BA hit 190 today

Picked up some cheap PFE 40c 9/18

Got into 6/19 35c and 7/17 40c NKLA calls today, lets see how this goes. Loving this DKNG pump right now too, memes can truly become dreams

HTZ TO 1.50 EOD GOOOOOOOOOO

also you mfs can still get in on MGM, it's easily going to 24 next week

PFE and RTX have brick walls at $36 and $67

Throw in SBUX at $80 also.

SPY 305 EOD and I’ll chop off my dick

DIS $123 let's go

question for people not buying DKNG 6/12 45 C's. Do you guys not like money?

Yep. 

I hate when that happens. 

I sold my MMM 160c 7/17 because it had weak movement and kept dropping. Sold when it was 152. 

36 hours later it was 160.

I have 10 AAL 12.5c 6/5 that I bought and have no day trades left, sweating profusely rn

Guys BUD is going to keep making steady gains till at least 65 idk what else to say

Oh fuck SBUX I was bag holding $80 for a minute it kept chopping at 76-78 for like 2 weeks

Okay guys give me some advice: I've got 200 shares of AAL and 100 LUV, I sold calls against them because I'm retarded. I'm way above my strike on both and can

a) let it be and let the call be executed or   
b) buy the calls back for a loss

BA 190 next week expo

BA Strangle 10 -185 6/19 C  and 9 -175 6/19 P

VXX under 30 for the first time since 6 Mar

SPY 6/5  313C

because 86,000 autists, myself included, saw the HPQ earnings "DD" and bought a why the fuck not call. Now they're holding 1 HPQ call worth 0.01 that will expire worthless tomorrow.

If SPY closes today above $313 then we’re going to see $340 by September

CZR 13c 6/19?

GLUU 7/17 11c

&#x200B;

you're welcome

DKNG 42 ceiling didn't last long

Who else holding 6/5 MGM 21.5 calls?

Imagine the year is 2020 and you are not long $BUD

6/19c $50

Can you guys rate my portfolio?

&#x200B;

725 BA $170 10/16

Ah that was from when it was VTIQ? I sold mine long ago so I just bought into a 6/19 35c today and it just hit green

All those things are already priced in by JPOW. SPY is going to 4000 next month.

Quick $500 in 10mjns on AAL call tendies

TSN 65 calls, get em now!!

July 17 AAL 10C bought weeks ago. These are amazing times we are living in boys

Just so everyone knows, SQ is almost a guaranteed to be above 100 this year. People fucking love that stock and it was getting ten bagger thrown around all the time back when it was 50 a share.

Shouldn’t have sold those 6/5 ERI 40c’s on Tuesday that I bought on Monday to basically break even....why the fuck wouldn’t I wait at least until open day lmao. Worth triple what I sold them for now

So, I bought two calls on VTIQ yesterday, I was down like $5 EOD and today on RH it shows a 0% change on the day, but I’m down $50?

ZM hits 200 today

Probably infinitely high given I sold my SAVE 7/17 $15 C when the stock was at $16.50. 

I need to really experience that regret.

Still looking at my portfolio wishing I’d held my 6/5 BABA 210c a few days longer

MGM 23c exp. 7/10 hold?

Ik now it is a wrong place but I need an advice. 


Like an idiot I bought 35 QQQ 327p  06/05 for 1.65 this morning. Should I take a L or hold it?

Wow my CZR $20c executed at $0.05 when average price was 0.09. Thanks whoever sold me that!

Take 200% on a 6/15 DL call or hold? Not sure if airlines are running out of short term steam

Same, 6/19 as well, took a small gamble on some FD’s as well to day trade. Just got upgraded.

GNUS hit like 7 breakers in less than an hour.

Fucking FB, get up to 235 you bitch

The audacity of beats to think we will have a pull back. ALL IN 6/12 312C $SPY

I’ve been doing real shitty lately so I bought a bunch of longer range calls on casinos a couple of weeks ago. lil MGM 8/21 19cs are keepin me alive today!

did that nikola ceo just said they stop taking orders as those trucks are 5 years out.  He doesn't know the numbers.  SMH...

Holy shit, is GNUS the biggest pump and dump of all time or what?? Anyone else watching this? Glad I got out at $10 earlier... 4th circuit breaker already this morning.

you’re fucking dumb, I’m complaining that we got cucked out of more tendies. Buy call at yesterday’s close, only up slightly. Buy calls at open, only up slightly. If the MM would let SPY open at 309 instead of running it up to 311 at open that would’ve at least not screamed rigged

Hope you all got burned on GNUS. Warned you yesterday,


Should have been buying DKNG all day last 2 days.


Enjoy your bags rookies.

My only positions right now lmao. 7/17 45c DKNG, 6/19 NKLA 35c,  7/17 NKLA 40c and FMCI shares

Just a prediction, dont shoot. But this could be the other shoulder forming on a head and shoulders. Which would indicate a decent leg down soon, probably by 11 ET

Lol. SWBI mooning to regain its losses. My 2 cheap calls have life again.

Guys I'm up 100% overall!! Granted I'm only using Stimulus Check plus 200 I used to open RH account but I'm actually 100% up overall

Both NKLA options green lets go! 6/19 35c and 7/17 40c

Idk about any short plays with MGM right now. 6/26 or 7/2 calls perhaps, but I may just move on. Still have 30% shares in @ $19.50 gonna let those ride. Any good plays I should take my profits over to?

0 for 5 on earnings plays... Roku, crm, cldr, SMAR...

Okta and MDB up next. Cut it or hold?? Gotta get one right?

How is QE inflationary if inflation literally isn’t happening right now after the balance sheet has exploded? How can the 5 Year forward Inflation expectation rate be 1.54 if the expansion of the balance sheet is inflationary?

AAL August 20 call is up 70% in 30 minutes

When 2 sell ERI

AAL flight with $50 peanut bags on the menu....bullish

Every economics textbook published post 2020 will be prefaced with "WARNING: STONKS ONLY GO UP." It's a new paradigm sir.

Buffett stoopid. I bet he wants to buy my 2000 shares of SAVE LMAO

I just bought 1 stock of DKNG. AMA

DKNG TO 43 EOD

Big money keeps spending millions on SPY 7/2 puts...

Isn’t anyone looking into this?

If you sold your 6/19 Baba calls for a loss,  


F

Hit 36 NKLA!!

Just bought some CVS calls. Do the DD for me, I am autistic.

69c 6/26

Damnit, sold my AAL 6/5 $11.5 c yesterday for a meager 180% gain.

Hahaha my LUV 42.5c 6/19 are up 300%

HDS is going to come through. It's still early for an earnings play.

06/19 $35c

GNUS dead. If you didn’t hear there was an offering of 60 million shares for $2. It just hit its 3rd halt and has had a massive sell off

Isn’t VIX going below 30 an indicator for something?

Decided to make some poverty bets with left over buying power. These NLY 6/5 6.5c's be printin.

Holy fuck I’m making a killing on the TSN FD’s I bought yesterday. 600 percent haha

BA TO 200 EOD!!!

I also bought 200 shares of Delta @ 20.50 and sold at 22...

I also bought 400 shares of CCL @ 8 and sold all but 100 at 12...

I feel dumb

I have stupid BA $275c 6/19 that are up 25%. Is this a keep it situation or dump

NKLA $40 EOD?

sold  AAL 7/17 11P and this shit is mooning

I guess it's SPY 315 FD's

If my DAL 6/19 35c’s start to print today... lol...

Literally dumb to panic sell MGM when room to rise is up to $25 and underestimating the power of zombie hoard gambling addicts and holiday makers

DIS 124 pls

NKLA hitting $40 today

AAL $20 EOW

LUV almost at 40 and my 40C expires Jan 15

DIS AT HIGHEST IN 3 MONTHS

I've been holding like 60k in various airline stonks for like 5 weeks and everyone was talking about AAL bankruptcy I was shitting myself. Today I can tell Buffet to suck my pp. J Pow you brilliant bastard you saved us all

Anyone asking to sell MGM before they've even opened is an absolute clown. Play through the weekend and Venmo me $50 when you cash out your ten bagger.

I bought 5 share of Gnus this am and 15 yesterday. I can’t but the fucking 15 I bought yesterday because I added some today. Fuck you PDT

My BA leap I sold for a small gain would’ve been up 1000% if I held 3 more days samn

sell 10 AAL 13c 6/5 to turn it into a debit spread and as your purchased calls increase your calls you sold will decrease which essentially would create no change to your already realized gains

DKNG @ 43 EOD??

SPY breaks $313 it’s gg.

qcom baby keep it up. Make me all my money back. Picked up a few PFE 7/17 38c and looking for BA to dip cause I couldn't fill 7/17 200c earlier when it was down at 181

managed to grab JBLU 7/17 $12c this morning

up 500 on the NKLA option I bought today, do I sell this shit?

Yeah, but I bought SAVE around 8 bucks. 8 bucks.

I sold at 13, so yeah, nice weekly gain. But shit is 20 fucking bucks right now lmao

DKNG  6/19 50c -- SELL OR HOLD

LUV $35c7/17 and $40c 8/24 printing hard today

I've been staring BUD 60c in the face all morning and can't pick a date

So I have a question my June 12 MU 50s printed bigly so is the strategy to sell the premium immediately and then roll out to an OTM position?

Dudes old and has too much money to risk on yolo 420c 4/20 SPY calls. At this point, I think he just wants to not lose any of it.

CRWD is done. Absolute flaccid dick strentgh. Overextended AF. Crushes earnings yet can't even break $100 when ZScaler well above. Correction to sub-90 incoming. Cashed out calls & put gang.

When should I cash out these 7/2 MU $50c's ?

WORK 40c all big tech companies shifting to WFH. They are gonna crush estimates. This is my last play then cash gang.

How the hell is anyone willing to buy 6/12 AMC 5c for 0.45 bid when its at 5.20 right now. Like whats up with that? I just want to buy out of my sold call at a reasonable profit, not a pathetic one.

> The NBA is looking to finalize a plan for a return to play with an announcement expected to come Thursday. The idea is that 22 teams will return and play out the rest of the season in Orlando. With the projected timeline for the return, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Tuesday that the last date for the 2020 NBA Finals would be on October 12. That would be Game 7.

If you want discounts on puts that will print BUY 06/12 ZM

Something is afoot with SU

6/19 19c volume is through the roof

Hopped into some more SCWX on the dip. 6/19 15c & 7/17 17.5c

ORCL is the hidden gem boys, 55c 6/19

RTX 7/24 calls are pretty cheap right now.

NIO gonna rally. 7/17 10c

MSFT isn’t going past $185 anytime soon huh.

Picked up some AAL puts when it spiked over 15 for a quick 20%.

Imagine not grabbing these AAL dips. I'm long 8/21 $20c

That’s how I sold my 7/17 160c for BA when it was at 155.

Don’t do it!

TSLA fades every time it gets close to 900 smh. When it finally breaks it’ll skyrocket to 1k

QQQ is at a new 52 week high today. You could buy right before the corona crisis and break even by now. I love this memey market.

MLHR $30 6/19 call

NBA return annoucement at 12:30 ET, BUY THE FUCKING DIP  

44 @ EOD

Hold BA 185c for tomorrow? I’m thinking it will moon again overnight

Sold NKLA calls for a solid 300% or 400%. Moved calls out to 6/12 and 6/19 and bought shares

Everyone in GNUS please refer yourself to PLAG October 19, 2018 graph to see your future.

If SPY breaks 313 today, it will hit 400 tomorrow.

Zm is worth $18-20 max. Idk what type of trenbolone that stock is on right now, but a 2000 P/E just doesn't make sense. That valuation makes sense if everyone on the planet used Zm.

Is it just me or has MSFT hovered 183 for like 3 weeks now?

This is the hardest I’ve ever gotten theta raped so far out from expiry

DKNG 50c 06/19.

Actually negative on it today after it going up almost $2.00

OK PFE, enough 36 consolidation. It's breakout time! Announce a vaccine or something, whatever it takes.

Had AAL $15c 6/19 @ 0.14. Sold at 100% profit but missed out on another like 800%. 

I feel like im just as annoyed as if my contracts expired worthless, which is super irrational. Still— why do i bother when even if i capture a solid profit, ill always look back and feel just as shitty if it turns out it wasn’t the *perfect* time to sell (or something close at least)?

NBA return annoucement at 12:30 ET, BUY THE FUCKING DIP

The resistance for CZR to stay above 12 is insane.

And stressing over when to sell DIS 6/5 $123 and $124 calls

Im thinking of getting back into airlines as soon as my brokerage transfer is complete since I get a 90 day ban from RH

MGM trying to get to 22 like premarket

COTY 7/17 8$ is printing. Up 150% from 2 days ago. Talks with Kardasian taking place, hopefully a deal goes through

lets gooo BA broke 186 resistance

BA 200 tomorrow?

Come on NKLA. Make $37 your bitch.

Sell or hold BA 6/12 200c

hey, it's me. the autist that yolo'd 10k into 6/5 311c SPY this morning. i made 4k in 1 hour but I also lost 3k on NKLA after buying at open and panic selling. i'm really good at *almost* making a shit load of money (if i didn't sell the NKLA i'd be fine, it went back up) that was really intense guys, maybe the most intense hour of my life. oh i also yolo'd 11k into 6/12 12.5c MGM calls this morning and holding those at least until EOD. fuck i think i'm addicted.

BUD 56 EOD

even between the GNUS halts, Trading212 hasn't let me sell at all, it's stuck like 10 mins behind. I tried to sell at $9ish and it just won't do anything

ZM 6/5 200p about to print. ZM plunging can't get a bid

i'll take either after fomoing into a 50c 6/5 FD.

Is this market real life???

DD: the sun is still shining an puppy’s are still cute 

TLDR: SPY 315 EOW free money

GGB gonna be $4 by end of next week.

Why would you not buy Boeing rn? Easy $220 by 6/19 exp. People WANT TO TRAVEL!

Where my MGM $23c 7/17 gang at

DKNG $45 we all need your virgin luck on these already solid calls

For those that remember, on April 29th a guy pissed in a bottle and drank his own pee if the SPY reached a certain level, I think 280. I was so elated on that day, everything pumped, and that was the top. The 2 weeks after that were pretty bad. We need to wait for another similar video like that to know if we've hit the top.

Anyone remember that period?

lads i dont think the whale cock blocking WORK $40 is gonna let this anywhere near $40 today. Faggots probably gonna dump AH hard too.

Just picked up DAL 6/19 puts

BA back to 186 lol wtf its gonna be 200 at this rate

MGM AT 22 EOD

Anyone know anything about MFA? One way or another I ended up with 200 shares (not sure I remember when or why I bought it, think I was fucking around with yolo calls and auto exercised at exp). Either way I’m up about 200 dollars on it and really don’t know anything about it.

Had 100 AAL 12 calls that I sold when AAL was at 13.20. Felt good about the gains, until it hit 15.45 like 10 minutes later. Glad for what I got but sad to miss that 23k extra.

9/18 $3 LTM calls

My actual shares portfolio up 25% in two days

Lmaooooo PEOPLE GO 6 FIGURES IN DEBT TO LEARN THIS

COTY $6c 7/17, BA $250c 7/17, SPY $320c 6/20.   Lets gooooo

all this green is getting me high as f. 

SVC 7/17 $10c

Full blown short squeeze on everything airplane.  Had to roll my DAL $30 covered calls to $35.

Yeah but that was just a rumor. It’s been running like this consistently for almost 2 weeks. When there’s an update about Kim K or Kylie’s skin care sales, expect another massive gap up.

Had an extra $60 after all my trades so I decided to just toss it in JPM calls at 97

I made more off than $60 play than on my $3500 play on stocks

What the fuck

Sell CHWY 6/9 before earnings or if you got big balls and diamond hands hold through Earnings

NIO 6/12 7c. 

This is taking off. May deliveries hit record high growing over 215% YoY

$ZM 200p 6/12

Own VTIQ/NKLA 06/12 $39 calls. Hold on or sell at 50% profit

I believe the Kardashian sisters can take COTY from a 5 handle back to mid 20 handle, just give dem ladies some time

Elon do you see all this retards talk about NKLA? Time for $1000 TSLA

#ELON

MGM 23 EOD?

I am. I have 200 of AAL and 300 DAL and 250 BA, 400 CCL, and 300 NCLH

The last 2 weeks 54 has been a key resistance for AMD.... can we break through that shit today plz

MMG 23 EOD? No? Okay

30 contracts AAL 16c July 17. Sold 10 this morning for 400% gains. Do I hold the rest or should I just take the full profits... this might be one of the biggest % gains I’ve ever gotten

$TIF 20c 6/19  
Anyone else?

Americans Drink Beer. $BUD makes beer. Beer is best consumed with tendies. Tendies -> America -> Beer -> Tendies. I have created the perpetuum mobile money making machine.

Best DD of all time? I think so.

6/19c $50

MGM 6/26 30c...full send

Is FB finally hitting the reversal. Been trying to hit 6/19 but I was a little off. Spread getting tighter there. Haven’t lost much though. Rolling out.

Live by the GNUS die by the GNUS. Up to 7$ yesterday, down to 4 today. Fuck.

$NKLA $50 calls all day

MGM @ 22 EOD

dont miss out on the DKNG pump to $44 guys

Like that one guy said. UUP puts. 

7/27 25c. 

$5 a pop. Is it throwing money in the dumpster?  Maybe.

MGM @ 22 EOD

Fuckin' DAL.  Should have bought some options on them, but I did buy about 1000 shares after I heard Buffet bailed lol

My friends it is about time to meme GME again. $5c are 0.03 and it’s on a tear today and reports earnings next week. Good chance of covering and pumping above 5

I tried to post a ton of DD but the mods here are gay as aids. $WORK 7/17 55c & 8/21 44c

Holding DIS 110c exp. 8/21. Sell or nahh

shit maybe my DIS 140c 6/19 is back from the dead.

OK time out. Do I get out of my NCLH calls?

&#x200B;

6/26 20 Calls up 75% for the day. Or do I set a stop loss at 50% and hope for it go to ITM.

unrelated to todays trading but I just randomly looked at LL  that we all got trolled on with 1 week out expiration calls... its actually on a run where it would have made money, eventually, far enough out. But still, fuck that fag member that got us. He got banned for anyone that missed this happening.

Sigh. After doing so well ignoring the FOMO all week on GNUS, I opened my phone today and saw $11 and just couldn’t take it. 

Luckily only bought 50 shares and sold them all as it fell off a cliff. I’ll chalk it up to a valuable lesson. Big shoutout to MGM for keeping me green despite my stupidity

I bought 2900 shares of JBLU Tuesday morning.  Up 30% lol

Glad I held onto those DIS 6/19 125 calls.

Yepp. Bought about 1500 shares between DAL AAL UAL. Loving it.

headed for a blue sky breakout if it breaks $39.88. JFC I'm up %300 in 1 hour. I should take profits

MGM @ 22 EOD

MGM @ 22 EOD

DIS 6/5 129c. Big pop today/tomorrow then who knows

That's 6 circuit breakers now for GNUS this morning. Anyone who came on here and pumped them the past couple of days should be banned.

My random af $BOTZ $26c 0717 & $VOX $99c 07/17

I’ve been holding those for about a month

Shiiiit how long do I hold this ZM $210 put that expires tomorrow?

I’ve watched BA every 20 min since it was at 160 and didn’t buy out of fear. Wow

Same I stop lossed just under $10 and got in at 10.80. Knew it was stupid but so is this market so I figured it would have one more day of ripping. RIP to any GNUS holder who bought and isn’t ignoring work duties to watch their positions lol.

MGM @ 22 EOD

MGM @ 22 EOD

I can afford 2 LMT shares.

MGM 8/21 call what’s my play?

This is your last chance to buy SPY 400c 11/20, trading at a mere $0.16 right now.

Lmfao remember in March when this place was 1000 comments a minute of bear spam shitting on everyone possible. I was loading up the fucking truck on SPY QQQ TQQQ calls

Not 1000% but I bought AAL calls about 2 seconds before that massive candle... Hit the home screen button and saw +80%

DIS 140c 7/20 printing lmao

Anyone else buying into PFE today?

I got $38c 7/17

MGM to 22 EOD

just rebought

more down ZM, need these 210 puts to print

Sell DIS and grab profits now or is there a reason to wait? 6/12 expiry. Isn’t there an NBA announcement that they’re playing at Disney later today?

Ugh shouldve just held my DIS 6/19 120c instead of taking profits and grabbing higher calls

LUV is gonna hit $40 EOD

AAL will moon once it breaks 15 clean

Does anybody have any strategies for not checking your positions every 5 seconds? This has been leading me to Tp handing the crap out of things like BA 7/17 160c and DIS 6/26 120c and it’s making me realize I need to rethink my strategy and have
More confidence in my positions

Maybe if I just hold my $10 GNUS shares I can profit after all in a couple weeks? 


At least that's what I'm telling myself when I can't even get a market sell through...

Just drove by a Great Clips. 10 people outside waiting. Calls on RGS

Shit, I may end up selling my DIS 1/21/22 220 leaps way sooner than I expected at this rate.

A casual 37 point move in two weeks. Nice SPY

So was the huge volume in AZN 56c just a bunch of rumor following ?

If BA can break 189 we go to 200. Come on let's go BA

SPY 315c 6/8 free money

Boomer companies because they are cornerstones for  providing them a comfortable life for many people. 

That being said, $DFEN might be the best exposure I have seen in a long time and has the biggest run to make out of any other “safer” ones I have seen. It’s up $5 since a week ago. That will remain.

CCL still so low....all in? 7/17 $25c

Any tips for mentally getting over the fact that I sold my BA calls for 3 bux when they're worth 33 now?

So was the huge volume in AZN 56c just a bunch of rumor following ?

Fuck my damn paper hands. I sold my four 6/5 $32 UAL calls on Tuesday for freaking $110 cause it went red and the expiration was approaching and I didn't want to lose my money. They're now worth $2.7k.

I mean... Who would have guessed, but still. I still have 3 long term LUV calls I bought for about $200 that are now worth $2k though so it's not all bad.

7/17 SPY 280p are only 2.55 a piece... so tempting man.

MGM @ 22 EOD

Setting a $21 stop loss on SAVE. Calls have made more money than I expected and I have 120 shares at 9.50avg. I’m a long term bull but I gotta play it smart

Got in NKLA 55c Aug

LK can smd.  I bought that shit 5 mins before it halted and had my money tied up for weeks.

Selling SPY 315c is free money

sold my 6/12 35 calls this morning at 1.50

they are at 2.63 now.

sold because I lost a lot on 6/5 AMD calls should have held

Same with me on AAL 15.5c 6/12 and BUD 56c 6/12

$SPY is now up over the last 6 months.

SPY 320c 6/12 here and It's all over the fucking place

So mad I sold my JPM 6/19 110c's I bought for .20 last week

Feeling pretty good about my DAL JAN '21 calls bought a few weeks ago. My only regret is not buying more... Definitely makes my SPY MAY 15 PUTS that expired worthless feel like a good lesson learned.

AMD is killing me, down 40% on 60c 7/17 calls

To however pumped FMCI thank you- I bought 1500 at open

28-30 PT next 1 month

Holy fuck. AAL 6/5 calls right on the money line are up 3350%

If you're on BUD check out the weaker but similarly moving TAP.  7/17 calls on both

Is it crazy to get a $50 call for July on NKLA ???

If you think the globalists are going to let trump run on a recovered economy you’re kidding yourself.

5k on 23c SPXS 10/16

Quick I need a "How to" on Calls in Thinkorswim so I can bust my option cherry and stop buying. DKNG 7/17 @ 45? price is 4.60 so that's what I pay now ya?

Made $400 on the way up with BA, and another $315 on the way down. Could have been a lot more but RH is laggy as hell. What's a good non-laggy mobile app?

Guess who cut losses on AMD puts about 5 minutes ago... This fuckin idiot right here.

did GNUS stop trading? price froze for 10 minutes

That DIS dip got bough out faster than a 5 dollar hooker.

Please NKLA run off the tsla hype. Don't mention that there is no production till 2021 or that hydrogen engines has a longer list of viability issues than my arm before I'm out my positions.

SPY -0.23% after being +10.00% in 2 weeks.... "bUlLs R fUk"

I did buy 10 mins ago lol. Actually shorted SPY @ 312.56

TSLA back to 820 POS

I am about to suddenly sound like an option noob again, but yesterday I bought a put expiring in 27 days. SPY is now lower than it was when I bought the put and yet I'm down 25%. I understand theta decay but going from 27 days to 26 days was a quarter of my put's value???? How did it decay that fast?

what just happened to SPY in the last 30 minutes?

same bought 35 SPY 313p 06/05. Did you see any news?

DIS 7/17 $125s letsss goooo

TQQQ really showing why triple leverage ain't a long term hold on that 6 month chart

Su gave me a lot of tendies when AMD dropped to 49 a few days ago but my god the way she cucks the current call holders is just cruel

AMC is straddled with debt and no one is going to bail them out. 

They will be dissolved and sold. Take a look at their balance sheet. Their stock is going to go for pennies on the dollar. 

3 dollar puts are basically guaranteed to make money if you get them long enough out. Check the

JEEZ, managed to squeeze in MGM 7/17 21s!

Lol, uh.. DOW is down 26 points right now. It will be up 200 by EOD. You know how it goes bro.

Thoughts on NKLA 40 EOD or EOW?

I love TSLA. Quick $300 in 2 min.

DKNG IV drooped 20%, 6/19 calls are free money, right now

Bears don’t be dumb. This is a trap. PJ traders gonna make this hit 315 tomorrow just on inflation alone.

It's possible. I'm not screaming SPY 240. Just saying the last 4 weeks are very abnormal and the days of green every day and red days illegal are very likely done. We will have some downward pressure in the next couple of months

Who the fuck says that the first option is free

My first one is GRUB 47.5put, expire worthless then I sold 29c TCOM to feel the theta gang power. Now it actually come so close to the strike price I buy TCOM 29c instead and now it’s going down

3 plays and all fucking wrong, please kill me

Managed to sell BA too late and too early. Should have made 700 at open but sold at the first dip just to watch it rally again.

Get in for the rise of airlines. Dont just fuck with one. Trade the sector etf premiums are cheaper near the money. 
$JETS $20c 7/17

I'm all in MGM 6/26 30c....bless me casinos for once

I was about to go all in on DOCU about 2 days ago.

Thank god I didn’t.

"NOW THATS A RUG PULL" SPY is up 40 in like 3 weeks lol

A selloff at some point, it was below 50 at 44

Thoughts on 7/18 PFE 38c?

I’m in on DIS 125c and waiting for a good price on SPY 115

PFE 36c 6/12 for a good day/swing trade. Its been bouncing back and forth between 35.6-36.2 for a few days now, just sell when you're up

We'll be positive about it. MGM resorts don't open for 2 more hours.

Holding MGM 17.5c for 7/2 and 20c for 7/17. Im up like over 100% on the 17.5c, should i sell and secure some of the bag or hold for max tendies?

SPY to 330 or bust idc what it takes

Went from $100-$2200 peak in eTrade, looks like it's going back to $100 thanks to DOCU.

SPY 200 SMA on the 5m after an extended move down - perfect quick scalp play off the bounce.

7/17 280p if you play SPY

SPY 320 lets go

FBI stats 2017:

Blacks killed by whites: 264

Whites killed by blacks: 576

Kind of confused as to who the racists truly are

THat person that bought about 200k worth of  SPY $20 put make money yet? LMAO

Today is not for the paper handed. I FOMOd into BA at open, so far I’ve been up 600$, down 300$, up $1100 and down $600. I’m riding this bitch until tomorrow

#WITH THE BACKING OF MY FELLOW AUTISTS IM PULLING COUP ON WSB AND THETA GANG

#IM THE THETA GANG 5 STAR GENERAL

HPQ 19c 6/19.

So apparently GNUS is going to be halted every 15 minutes.

Or dont buy 6/5 VXX 40c

BUY THE DIP!!! WE ARE GOING TO 400 EOM

SPY 330c 6/30

 CHAPTER 11 FILINGS ROSE 29% IN MAY FROM APRIL - ABI 

&#x200B;

IT'S HAPPENING!!!!!!!!!!!

It’s over fuck you Peloton fags. It’s Vegas time baby, fuck an indoor bike. PTON to $20 in a couple weeks.

Just sold out of my -50% ANAL plan call for 6/9 DKNG FD Call LOL

SPY should be $250 max right now

I can't imagine BA pulling this off 3 days in a row. Thoughts?

SPY won't touch $313 again until the stocks get nice and fat. Algos are triggered to sell hard and fast at $313, unless they push that strike out.

MGM gonna hit 23 today, just wait 1230 explosion to Mars

Imma let Bill fuckin Barr do his authoritarian thing before I put my helmet back on. Back into my SPY 350C 7/17 then.

imagine thinking MGM was not going to hit $22 today

GNUS halted 3 times today?

Right? Been such a lame duck for awhile. I’m averaging into 190 calls. MSFT doesn’t like to move until it does. And I feel it soon

TSLA gave me 3 chances to exit my 890c and 900c FD's for tmrw. ***3 chances***        
             
Every morning there was a spike. Tuesday was up $800, Wednesday only up $200, today, down 2k. Made $1000 take home on Monday and said... Said I was going to sit out the week.

SHOP is the big brain play, sub 650 by end of next week, chart says it all

WSB pls each buy 1 call on DKNG thanks

If BA isn't 200 by EOW I will never recover from my FDs

Yeah 1/3 of it was a 6/5 BA 190

Added a bunch more 7/17 $23 MGM on the dip. Let's do it boys.

MSFT 6/5 $185 are only .68

AAL calls 1 month out

No TWTR go down bb, gotta have my 30p 6/12’s print

BA to $250 end of next week?

original ERI/CZR merger offer was $8.40 plus ERI stock that worked out to about $12.75 but the pandemic fucked everything up since ERI's stock tanked during the crash. now we dunno if they're going to adjust their offer when the merger is finalized. as such it was rangebound in $8 to $10 for awhile then slowly melted up to $11 but it will likely be resistant to go much more above that until later.

Yeah, because its a spread. It's typically more volatile to the downside. A 270p is 11.75 and a 352c is 3.50.

Thoughts on UL? Just based on the fact companies like Ben and Jerry's are being so vocal with their support? I'm thinking 6/19 $60c

Up $3 on my SPY 6/19 SPY call I just bought... hold or sell?!

Put a call on LUV 6/12 for $13 last night, already doubled. How’s the time

Just picked up some MFA 7/17 calls.  Well below their consistent pre-Corona price and earnings coming up.

Let's go BA need you to hit 190 today.

SPY $310c 6/12 bought slightly after open today

Some guy posted VIAC and since I'm retarded I jumped right in. Up 36% tho. 7/17 30C

Goddamn it DKNG, I wanted to get in sub 40 and you took off already

SPY 6/5 312c

 TRUMP TEAM ENVISIONS UP TO $1 TRILLION FOR NEXT STIMULUS ROUND 

&#x200B;

SPY $350 CONFIRMED, USD TO 0.

DKNG is a $100 stock.  Change my mind

Holding UAL $45 and DAL $35 December calls.

Based on what exactly? 2020 earning expectations for $175 for SPY. It's now $125 with Corona. That's a 28% decrease. $250 right now essentially never recover from Corona level earnings in the 20 years the market is looking forward.

People laughed at me for buying dirt cheap DIS $135c 7/17 calls last week... guess who is up 110% so far

Bro, how we gonna act like pushing DKNG through $41 is this big challenge?  Rip to $45 already you piece of shit.

*SPY falls less than 2 points*

Bears: OH THIS IS IT THIS IS THE COLLAPSE

Loading up my 7/2 MGM and DKNG.

not really sure why i used the SPY chart... it was jut up in front of me and im clearly autistic... but take a longer term look say last 5 years QQQ is up \~120% and TQQQ is up \~340%... or ten years QQQ is up \~420% and TQQQ is up \~5,100%... it can def be held long term but you would want to trade around it

Would recommend against it, both DAL and LUV CEOs have come out and said there will be a 30% contraction until 2023 which is the estimated full recovery. Since share price is going to be future looking, gains will slow the closer airlines get to full recovery

Please make me look away from TSLA 900c for end of month...

DKNG 6/12 145 calls are still legal, contrary to what you may have heard.

It's founded on an argument that there will be a massive tech sell-off or reduction in price and QQQ will crash. Most companies pulled or reduced guidance for the upcoming quarter, so I don't believe that he's correct. If I guessed, sector rotation will cause tech to sit flat for summer or go down slightly, but large cap tech stocks are still seen as the best long term play in the current economic environment.

Do you think Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and fucking Pepsi are going to crash in the next 3 months? I understand the argument for Apple specifically (I don't agree with it, but there is a logical argument there) but the rest, no fucking way. Why does qqq have a lot of Pepsi, I got no fucking idea.  


The same poster suggested a similar TQQQ strategy before and it's up like 20% since his first post. I firmly believe it's a scam to sell puts.

STNG too. I sold some STNG puts a few days ago at ~16.5 because I thought around there would be the bottom. Closed yesterday at 17.3 for some decent profit just in time for it to tank down to 15 lol

yo what the fuck is the GLUU volume on 11c 77/17

110k volume

My 8/21 $17 AAL calls up 200% lets gooooooooo

BA retesting 188 by EOD?

This is like the 10th time SHOP has touched 750 support last 2 weeks. It's a magnet. Hopefully we finally move the pivot up this week. I'll donate 100 to charity if it retakes 800 by EoW.

Just made $200 off my AAL calls I’ve been holding since May. NEVER DOUBT YOUR VIBE

Fuck, need BA up. yolo into 190c for tomorrow

The NBA Board of Governors phone conference meeting starts in one hour. Expecting a quick vote and announcement from Adam Silver before 4 pm EST.

I have a few small WFC 7/02 $30 positions. Hold or get rid of them? I don't like Wells Fargo as a company, but the calls were cheap.

PD also.  I've got long positions in all 4.  Hoping we see serious rallies in at least 2 of them...

MGM - give us one more lift off to $23 today and i swear i will take my tendies and put them all on black at the coveted MGM roulette tables.

I think so as well. I never buy way OTM anyway. Like if TQQQ was really going back to 35, why wouldn’t I just want to pay a little extra for an ATM put and be $45 ITM? Makes no sense to play OTM like that unless you have millions of contracts

Should I sell my ETSY stock at $82? I’m up $25 overall thinking of riding it out longer or just jumping ship now. Tell me the move boys

Low key and boring BAC 30c 9/18 giving me the tendies 70% in the past two days.

Zoom Market Cap: 60 Billion

Ford Market Cap: 24 Billion

GM Market Cap: 40 Billion

The friendships we made along the way: Priceless

let’s pray cause I sold my SAVE 6/12 12.5c’s last week for 1.05 and it’s now at 7.95

Just bought July 2 VXX 30.5c.

Sold MGM today at the tippy top, made 110%. Shouldn't have bought my contracts ITM on Monday, I bought at $17, could have made ~200% instead. Profile is now from 20k to 36k.

Now, all that's left is my DKNG 55c 7/17. Down 5,000 on it. Gonna hold for a bit to see where it'll head. With sports reopening, we could see some good shit on the way.

Imagine not investing in DAVE PORTNOY... PENN  was $5 and only $36 now see you in $50s

Still tumbled quite a bit from an hour ago. I think there’s support here and I think it’s gonna touch 40 EOW

Got some VXX 60c for 7/17

Is NKLA even a decent long term hold? Won't it just flounder for the next 7 months at least?

EVRI 9/18 $12.50c, thoughts?

Anyone nervous about DOCU calls? I have 6/12 $150s calls

lmaoo my 25 contracts i was holding jumped and i ended up selling for 200%. NDYV!

So my SPY 400c 11/20 can print.

If DKNG hits $42 today I'll jump out my second story window.

> The NBA Board of Governors phone conference meeting starts in one hour. Expecting a quick vote and announcement from Adam Silver **before 4 pm EST**...

TEAM 175c 7/2

SPY has a lot of unfinished business in the gap between 308 and 310. Holding puts with skeleton hands until 309 is breached then riding the bull again

I forget sometimes that SPY tracks the s and p 500 and not the other way around lol. God bless arbitrage algos.

I bought CAKE 20p 6/19 yesterday and i’m down 50% already, am I retarded?

Down 50% on my 6/12 FB call and I'm about to double down

Update: I was so emotional with how my TCOM plays go and instruction was unclear so I also bought LK 3c mid July

Looking for $DIS to go 125+, turn 125 into support and go to 128/129

The reason to buy the OTM put is the volume of contracts, but the risk is exceedingly higher. I do think TQQQ is probably going to sit flat or slightly decline for the next two months so I don't think ITM puts are a bad idea. I bought TQQQ in the 30s in march and sold off at $65 because I thought it peaked. I lost over 20% in gains doing that. To me TQQQ is a stay away.

BA to retest 188 would make my little pp happy

I was told by someone on here that 310 is the new floor and we'll never go below 310 again :D

SPY 315c 06/12

can we all just agree to pump LK up to $5 my calls will thank you

7/17s:

$21 MGM 
$125 DIS

I win.

So before I dump a bunch of fucking money following this ridiculous 111k volume on GLUU 11c 7/17, they just announced two days ago they're offering $100M of their common stock as a secondary offering, is that bullish or bearish

Why would there be 111k volume on that option

DKNG 43 eod calling it

Babe, it’s 12 PM! Time for your selloff!

Picked up 5 9/18 DAL 40c

RIP GF...SPY $314 EOD

MGM 20c DIS 120c checking in

Whose holding WORK calls through earnings? I have $40 calls will I get cucked? My wife’s boyfriends say I will get cucked I just want a second opinion.

I grabbed one bud 65 7/17 yesterday. I’ll try to grab one of TAP at least. Thanks.

6/19 $190 MSFT calls, anyone else up?

I have NCLH $20c 6/5 that I bought this morning

I don’t want to hold overnight

I can’t make a day trade (well I can but RH says I won’t be able to buy stock for 90 days)

Selling a call one strike above would net a 75% loss because for some reason the next strike is selling for way way less.

Do I have any good options? I already cannot day trade, if I do is it really only stock because that’s doesn’t matter.

Of course I bought BUD 60c at the exact wrong time today lololol

Pls print

MGM @ $30 EOM

They’re branded as a “Chinese Starbucks” in a culture that doesn’t drink very much coffee, so they’re inherently limited by being something of a niche. Their financials haven’t been good at all, the doctored the books an insane amount before the Chinese government found out, raided the HQ, and arrested the boss man for fraud. Trading of LK was frozen for months until it restarted a while ago, and now it’s trading around $3 where as before it was around $30. And this kind of scandal doesn’t help shakey businesses grow.

Went ahead and bought 7/17 SPR 37.5c.  How dumb am I?

DKNG preparing for another $42 break, waiting for that $44

NKLA sub 20 by next week

MGM was right around $31 before the plunge lol. I doubt it will get back to that for a while.

SPY 1D look like the 2020 YTD or is my microdose too high?

 One thing boys. If you're making good money this year don't forget that the tax law changed to allow you a $300 above the line charitable deduction. If you're making some money do good, donate, and take the AGI adjustment. You can deduct up to $300 w/o itemizing.

SPY 313 c

If BUD doesnt get back up to 56 today I'm drinking coors light tonight

SPY 400c for new years eve only .25 

Why not

If I had to take a $10k YOLO right now, gun to my head it would be DAL 6/12 $30p.

DIS 6/5 125

TRUMP TEAM ENVISIONS UP TO $1 TRILLION FOR NEXT STIMULUS ROUND

Some asshole got +3,800% return on LK $4 calls today fuck

DAL 6/5 $30p

just buying and selling TQQQ at 1 to 2% shifts a few times thru this and happy to hang onto it if i miss and we end down

Should I sell my NKLA 37c for tomorrow for a 50% loss or hold until it's worthless

Is LK for real? 

YOLO 100 $4 calls for tomorrow....

So essentially, it’s saying that stonks can only go up and the economy has basically recovered until a wave 2 drop in like September/October? 

DJIA $35000 confirmed

The next thing to make DKNG rip is the NFL. You don't think 2 weeks of huge gains were just because? NBA, NHL...priced in.

Made 300% returns on GPS 12c what a clown market this is

I'd have to imagine something like ZUO calls should be a slam dunk right now... Had great reation to earnings initially but seems to have dropped due to the sector-wide dump today

I bet any calls more than 2 weeks out will definitely print

Fucking BA go back to 188 already I have things to do with my life

All in 7/17 60 MU calls. No DD just think it may go uppies in next couple of weeks

All of these 6/19 calls I bought in March looked DIW on Monday. Now they’re almost all ITM. I should quit while ahead but why should anyone think this run won’t continue next week?

I got 6/19 200cs for BA.. up 60% rn sell or hold ?

FOMO bought GNUS at $11 and panic sold at $4.50 am I doing this right?

holding 1000 shares of VISL opened at 0.4

SHOULD I SOLD OR HOLD YOU FGTS?!?!

Doubled down on 7/17 JETS

NCLH is about to bust a bull nut...ships are docked at port, but not for long! $25 by tomorrow is given

15 mins holding LK 3c and I’m already 40% profit should I sell nuoooo

As a permabull, I'm fine with SPY dropping to 300 EOW so I can dump another $20k in before it takes off to 400 EOY

PLAY 6/5 $19 seems like free money

I have a few Nov TLT calls unhedged so going to explore more options.

I think VIX calls are a fine play at these levels. August 45c gives a little room but July premiums are better.

So who's the tard that lost 1/4 mil on LK?

No I got PFE $38c 7/17

MGM @ 22 EOD

MGM @ 22 EOD

sold 800 of my 1000 LK shares in my IRA on monday =/

MGM 9/18 25c

Whoever bought LK $4 calls probably just fainted

Bought $UAL 6/5 40$ calls for .8 each about a month ago, buffet happend and it crashed and barely could sell for .15 like 2 weeks ago. Today they were worth over 1$ fml lmao....

I sold my JETS shares today after 40% profit in 3 weeks

PLUG gonna hit 5 EOD!

Fuck it. MGM 30c 6/19

Sold my 6/19 $36 at the earlier dip FML. Sold a put for $100 though that's already up 25%.

HOLY GUAC look at that volume on PLUG,

twice as much as the normal average and its only 9 AM

$120 into $530 with MGM this week. If only my portfolio was green overall

tfw ZM is down almost 5% but my 7/17 $170p are down 10% on the day

Where have you been? My leaps are printing. I bought $60c for RCL for September nearly a month ago

So i averaged down hard on BA puts. Sold for a break even. Used all my buying power besides 32 bucks, someone throw me some random ass play

PLAY calls, could be back up to 30 in a month, stock was in the 40’s pre-Covid

PLNT $80c 6/19   ?????

just woke up... had 500 LK $3 calls... im shaking

TSLA 900c 6/5

PayPal me 10%

MGM 6/12 $26

A great chart to look at is 2007, most people think 2008 when they think mortgage crisis, but the issues were known earlier and the market reacted in late 2007 with a 20% selloff and then rally to highs before the downturn officially started in the 08 market. People don't usually look at that selloff but in the situation we are in, it might actually be something to take note of.

c'mon SPY bb, break back above $312 for daddy.

So I went in on MGM 6/19c $21.5 on the dip.

Do I keep holding or is this a today is the day to be in and out proposition?

I’m down 8,000 YTD up $500 this week

Just saw a MF article telling people that they should invest their $2400 stimulus checks. Guess spy is going to 600

Down on $SQ 7/17 calls, time to hold them bags...

I am already a marked PDT. If I sell one more it says I’ll be restricted from buying stocks for 90 days. 

DAE if that’s just stocks and not options? If so idc I only buy options anyway

NKLA 40c 7/17

ya'll should take a long look at how much $7 NIO Jan 2022 calls are going for rn

What companies other than DGLY do bodycams? Seems lile every fucking city and even some states are gunna make them mandatory. 

I know dgly has an ath of 25 but i doubt it breaks 5-10 unless they win bids but still bullish either way

A pathetic red day like this is just proof that SPY 350 is going to happen by election time before it finally snaps.

Anyone else see the unusual activity for the GLUU 7/17 11c?

OMFG I'M GONNA PUT 20K ON THE LINE TO PROFIT 20 CENTS IN A WEEK!!!!

Can you tell me your strike? I'm thinking 90C, I will never blame anyone for losing money, but I'm down so much and only a 10 bagger can save me. I'm about to all in on it because the last time someone made a comment like this it was ZS the day before it spiked 20%.

Thank you either way.

Tim Apple published an open letter on racism. 

Gotta sting for the sweatshop workers making 10 cents an hour in China when the CEO tells people who are getting pandemic unemployment and $1200 stimulus checks that he recognizes how hard they have it.

I JUST DROVE THRU A CROWD OF PROTESTORS, SPY IS GONNA GO TO 350 BECAUSE MORE DEATHS EQUALS LESS PEOPLE GETTING CORONA!!!!!!!

Just bought a bunch of $312 6/5s let’s see how it goes. NVDA $355c too cause why the fuck not, Friday’s have been good to team green.

How do we feel about PTON? Bought a 7/10 $50c on a whim when it dipped earlier this morning but then it kept dipping. Now I’m back to where I could break even and now I’m just not sure of my decision.

YOLO'd $5k into 6/17 WORK and PD calls. Here's hoping for good ER!

Holding my ZM 8/21 $35PUTS!!!! Fuck that shit company

Transferred a grand into RH from the wrong bank account, proceeded to lose the grand on LULU options, then got hit with a $750 overdraft statement haha I just went full WSB retard on accident

Fuck yeah, get below 40 DKNG I want in

/thinks about Comcast, which owns NBC and NBCSports, and also owns the Flyers and owned the Sixers until like 10 years ago

Yes.   
  
ECB's GDP growth expectations for the Eurozone:

-8.7% in 2020
+5.2% in 2021
+ 3.3% in 2022

So no full recovery before 2023.

I decided to go pretty long. 9/18 25c. A bit safer than my FDs

Go to like, $30 today LVS.

Not really, it was NCL. I have $20 which was $.48 and $21 was only $.13

MGM @ 22 EOD

MGM @ 22 EOD

MGM @ 22 EOD

i

MGM @ 22 EOD

J pitiful needs to let us leg down to 290-295 by EOD tomorrow so we can crank to 330 by end of June

Almost 25% of LVS’s daily volume was in the last 15 minutes

I’ve got an AMD $60 call down 99% and a portfolio up 5%  yet I’m trying to figure out my next option Play is

MGM @ 22 EOD

BUD is going to go
Parabolic.

ALSO.
500B repo tonight. Expect a slight dip then a retarded EOD spike for overnight pumping.


I’m buying 100 0tde SPY calls @ close

Woohoo my SPY 250p is printing!

Haven't placed a trade since Monday. As soon as I enter a call SPY down $1 in 10 min

Loaded 10 BA 1/21 300 leaps

Got AAL 6/5 13p 5 minutes ago I'm predicting EOD dump

Should I hold or sell my 7/17 AAL calls?

Still on PDT for another 45 days, lock gains on puts by selling same date 1 strike lower right?

 When you close the spread at Robinhood will it close them both at the exact same time when you order executes or say I sell my Put and then robin hood fucks up before I can buy the lower strike option, I just get fucked then right?

What gave AAL this push this morning? Feeling 6/5 puts...

Alright SPY, you spooked the bulls.  Back to 313 now

Damn risky bet given all the positive news possible for AMZN happens around the 6/22 massive sale.

We are at a temporary low. I think the stock will trade higher than it is now by EOD tomorrow. Of you can average down on the calls you might make a small profit when this goes to 2490 tomorrow.

Fuck BA. After being up almost 500% on 160/165 6/5 calls. I just looked at them and I sold at 6.80/10.35 yesterday from 1.15/2.52 now they are 18.40/23.20.

Now I am down 50% on my BA 200 calls for tomorrow, since I thought today was Wednesday.

I'm all in on 90C after seeing what happened to ZS haha, trying to get another 30 contracts filled at 10 cents

We had like 4.4 million 2 weeks ago and SPY went up 1.5%. Logic does not apply in 2020 my dude

anyone trying to pump GNUS to 20 bucks for me?

Sold my AAL 6/5 12c at open :(

Love how AMD doesn’t follow spy on the way up.... but follows it on the way down. Welp looks like AMD isn’t hitting 55 today. One less cactus I have to fuck

Is that a lot for VXX? Also added 7/17 $47 and $48 calls.

all in PFE 40c 7/17 see y’all in a month

I got PFE $38 7/17 lets hope we don't get fucked

If we can get AMD sub 50 by the end of next week I'm gonna nut

Cashed out my MGM friday calls just bought $MGM 22 6/17 am I going to print or am I retard

Bought 1000 shares of DLPN as my desperation play

Bulls zoom out 2 weeks on SPY and your portfolio and you’ll feel much better

Tempted to get SQ 6/5 90c

Top plays i'm holding. There should be a nice jolt up going into earnings very soon. WORK and DOCU i'm expecting stellar earnings.

I’m buying WORK $50c 8/21 at 20 minutes till close. Godspeed.

i pussied out of DIS 6/12 128 when the market started taking a shit. sold at .95. it steadied and got up to 1.1 and then dumped to .70

not mad at all..

PFE 7/17 38c

should i dip out of my TWTR 6/12 34.5c? Was up over 300% yesterday and now up 150%

wtf is this shit. SPY better finish at 312 at least.

did I really sell MGM and SPY calls at the tippy top today? easiest 7k of my life. if only I didn't lose 4k to NKLA this morning I'd prob quit my job. still, tendies are tendies. diamond hands activated for my DKNG 6/12 $42c

YOLO HTZ 1.5C 6/5 for quick riches!

Theta gang, sell HTZ calls expiring 2022 at a strike price of $1.5. You'll get 70 cents per share and the call will be worth 0 once the bankruptcy court approves the bankruptcy in a few months.

god i love LUV such a slutty fucking stock, always cumming out tendies 4 daddy

DOCU is down to $140 scary

TSLA has been playing with a lot of people’s assholes these past 2 days

LVS $53c 6/19

Big WORK 6/12 put buys, dammit

Same here, MSFT 190c 7/17, and a couple different strikes on AMD for 7/17 as well

because people are dumb? There's every possibility SPY hits $330 by September.. easily January. Not saying it will happen, but it's not improbable.

AMZN 2470 calls and SPY 314 calls. Was up $2000 today now I’m down $3500

BA 240 August exp

I have 6/5 $53c on LVS....does this shit rebound or what?

ZM 6/5 40p loving it

Problem is though that everyone would just do this shit all again, and SPY would be at 450 the day after

GL dude. I just dumped my 6/12 right before the after lunch pump and got some grocery $...but i'm still in the game and figure its going down harder today...but i want to eat so paper hands lol

I went all in on SPY 7/17 315c, just gonna get off and not look at my portfolio

MU 7/2 $60 calls up 150% since yesterday, sell or hold

Your breakeven price would be $2.2 with the premium you are getting. The only risk is if the court says that HTZ stakeholders will get more than $2.2 per share which is extremely unlikely since their book value is negative $20 per share.

buy the dip- **SPY Dec 16 2022 525 Call**

Would have loved to buy ZI puts 30 min ago

>I went all in on SPY 7/17 315c, just gonna get off and not look at my portfolio

I'll just give you some updates here, Oh snap! Things are not looking good. Resistance is breaking....oh god no

went to lunch, came back to see my SPY 6/5 313C at 50% loss.Guh.

MU will most likely get near $60 by July but they’ll probably dip before then and the theta will banish your profit to the shadow realm. I’d personally sell and buy back in at a dip.

AYX calls looking good value. Just picked up 3 for jun19.

>DOCU 

Price target is currently 170.  


!remindme in 4 hours

So 313 and 310.5 are both impassable.

Weird to see such a tight range last almost 24 hours now. VIX will get murdered if it holds another day in here.

 $DOCU
6/12 $160 calls, 

$WORK
 6/12 $45 calls, and 

$MDB
6/12 260 calls.  

All moving up nicely going into earnings tonight. Trying to beat the rush and holding DOCU and WORK.

MCD 220c July 17th buy me up boys

85 contracts AAL 13 6/5 .06 cents a piece free money

I personally don't think it is too late to get back in, since DOCU will probably report insane earnings AH and moon tomorrow. Just be sure to make your calls at least 2 weeks out

They dipped yesterday after that run up earlier in the week. Premiums have been surprisingly low after buffet dumped. Bought 8x $13c 6/5 AAL at .09

Those $39p DKNG assholes might have fucked it up for everyone. Enjoy staying flat until your shit expires worthless as well, assholes.

Hey guys, I just realized a $4k loss on my 6/19 BA $140 short call. BA will now proceed to tank. You are welcome

Made 197% profit on $20 AAL calls today that I got for dirt prices let's see if i can evaporate these gains in the next week

At 281 got lucky lucky with my 1 spy call. Doubled it and bought FB, DIS, AAPL calls and a few others along the way lol

So who's in on BA 6/19 200c?

What's your exit strategy for BA 6/19 calls? I am thinking of taking profits and rolling into 7/17 185c. Any thoughts?

If you're holding OTM options expiry tomorrow, WORK will need to go up or down about $3 for you to be at the point you are right now, assuming the IV drops to around 120-150 from where it's at now.

Wow $CRWD. Looking like it's going to be a runner today and tomorrow. Shorts r so Effed. Grabbed some 6/12 110 C for cheap.

All in DDOG 6/19 90C, hope it's the next ZS lol

My HTZ $1.50c 6/5 calls are ALIVE!

OMG idiots are still bidding up HTZ like there is no tomorrow. Volume is approaching 80 million and the stock is up more than 60% even though it will be wiped off after the bankruptcy court gives ok.

Wow $CRWD. Looking like it's going to be a runner today and tomorrow. Shorts r so Effed. Grabbed some 6/12 110 C for cheap.

How are we feeling on NERV calls going up? Fairly low right now at $0.48 for $5c 6/19, I think with some guidance and clarification on they're trials, these could climb. They had a massive drop this past week, and are super undervalued.

Is anyone shorting TLT? Thinking 6/19 150p

There is a 38000 volume candle on FB... how?

im a retard still holding 6/5 NKLA calls, watching it in freefall

Just got 6/19 315 spy calls. LEZZ GO

I love BA 6/5 185p here

Just joined in 20 SPY 7/17 315c

Just bought $22.5p 6/5 on MGM because this shit is silly. No one is going to a casino during the pandemic.

If you are interested in a relatively low risk financial play, WFC 6/18/21 50 leaps are still under 40 each. Could take patience or could jump up quickly, in this market who knows

MGM could realistically hit 25 EOW when the news hits at 4 about busy they were

HTZ 2 dollar calls

what level dumb am I for DOCU 150c 6/5?

737 MAX approval by Congress would moon BA a minimum of $25 overnight. RNG when that happens though.

Sure I’ll take $900 per share of NKLA plz

WFC high risk - 6/19 35c $10 each

UAL 7/17 45c's far out enough? Surprised there's no higher strikes

God I hate waiting. Why can’t NKLA just shoot up to $900 already like TSLA? Fuck around and wait 10 years for tendies fuck outta here.

Sigh.

$CRWD - just suggested by MOTLEY FOOL - BUY. Wow $CRWD could be a multi day runner. Shorts are Effed. 6/12 110 calls is what I'm playing for max returns.

WORK + PD all day (I have both).

Honestly, PD is the sleeper hit here. I do web operations for tech companies and 90% of companies use PD for critical monitoring and alerting. When reddit goes down, I guarantee 20 employees are getting calls from PD.

DIS getting to $124.5 was the mooning in the first place. It was $114 4 days ago.

If spy goes up BA Is gonna hit 190 easy

Guys are we holding MGM or cash out. Currently up 40% on 6/19 $23c

MGM is going to $25, and if your calls are long dated, ER July 23. Will probably be $30 by then.

GWRE really spanked me today - Up $10 AH - opened -$5.00

I’m fairly confident almost no matter what we do today we open around 312 and tickle 313s taint tomorrow.  If job report isn’t that bad, and remember we are expecting horrible, than we busting a nut on 315.  

SPY 312c 6/12, 313c, 315c 6/19

Was going to buy HTZ on Monday but bailed. Going to wash my mouth out with 12 gauge. byeeee

VXX at 40 would be a wet dream

Sold 30 naked HTZ calls expiring in 2022 for 50 cents per share. My breakeven price is $2.5 per share. Currently stonk trades for $1.3 and realistically it's worth $0 because it's already in the bankruptcy court with a tangible book value of negative $20 per share.

I planned to buy these today but ran out of funds. Still might swing out of my MU $50 6/12 into MSFT but I’m holding MU till EOD or tomorrow.

MGM 25c 6/19 is probably retarded right

Yeah but but that doesn’t mean we can’t ride the wave of positive sentiment while we can. 

There were rich former-Romans in 480 CE.

Do I have a better chance of winning Masters 2021 tickets or DKNG ending the week over $45?

hey can someone buy my 2 contracts of SPCE 6/5 20.5c for like 4 bucks, need moners to make some more plays

I stole my 20 measly shares yesterday and sold RIOT today so FYI buy riot I’m always early

Oh shit, which strike price? I sold 2021 puts @ $0.50 too. If HTZ got delisted, we get freed from obligation and tendies. If for some miracle it got merged to reconstructed, HTZ jumped back up, we still get free tendies. Literally can't go tits up!

From your nut to Powell's ears.

SPY 315c 7/17

YOLO ZM 7/17 170p, MU 6/5 50p

>There were rich former-Romans in 480 CE.  

Lol excellent analogy

LK $6 by close Friday, let's see it!

I’m up 800 today sold cake and rebought it’s down like 40 rn but I have mgm and penn calls and bought stock in LK. Good day overall

BA getting ready to go all 737 MAX on my asshole

The battle for PLAY to break and stay above $19 right now is electric

Do I just call it quits in my NKLA calls for 6/5 35c ?

$SQ $90 call for 6/5??

DKNG moonshot in 1 hour

If you think NVAX will produce a vaccine out of the 250 companies trying, I have a beach front property for sale in Ohio for you! But 7/17 puts. By then their trials will have failed and the virus scare will be over! Do not miss the boat on all of these fraud companies that made a killing on vaccine news. BUY PUTS.

has anybody been marked PDT for consistently using their 3 day trades each week on RH?

Huh? I bought 100 SPCE at 14/share and have made the entire investment back selling monthlies

Tired of tech stocks fcking me upside down

So as retarded as I am I Just put half on portfolio in 2021 ATVI leaps and leave it all to Allah

First, they already filed for Chapter 11. Second, it's less than 1% of my portfolio so it would have to go up A LOT for me to get a margin call. Third, even before corona hit them, they were on the verge of bankruptcy with negative $20 book value.

SPY 305 EOW

Hold JETS or sell? 7/17 20C

I got banned from a lot of subreddits earlier this year when I was in a pro meat anti vegan phase.  I got banned from r/fitness, r/AskReddit, and r/politics for pretty mundane shit since I am always pretty offensive and have been a longtime submitter in those subs.  R/AskReddit let me back in after I drew a picture of a banana escaping from jail. R/fitness won’t respond to my messages so I just call then faggots by direct message every so often.  R/politics keeps making me wait 3 months.  I told them they were just mad I didn’t suck their dick long enough in my reply to appeal my name.

Bought BA calls when it dipped to 180 today... KKEEEEEP MOOONNING BA!!!

went in pretty hard on FB 227.5c 6/12 lol, this is gonna backfire isn’t it?

I remember 6-7 interest rates on CD's. I actually had a 5 yr CD that was 6 percent back in 2008.

$3 200 6/12c BA

... Someone tell me to do it!!

1/21 ASML 300c boys, 1.3 Trillion euros being printed as I type. you are welcome.

Opening a position in AAL at end of day. AAL is going to $20 by end of month minimum

Lol now BA is running. Oh my could see 200 tomorrow is SPY rallies

Dropped 10k on AAL 6/5 16C feeling risky today

SPY went up 10p in May. I'm not holding to expiry but today was a good day to pick up calls.

anyone know what the fuck PLUG is? just bought 100 6/19 poots for like 450..

Im glad I picked up more LK shares at the bottom. I was down 90% at its low. Bought a measly 100 shares at the bottom but they’re killing it

$SPY $220 6/12

Just sold my PK $10c 10/16 for a $21k profit. Been holding these puppies for 2 months. I’ve already got heavy FOMO because I really believe this stock has another 40% to go but I let some fellow investing buddies convince me it’s time to take my 160% return and walk. What’s the next move??

SPY 314 6/8

Bought these BA 6/19 200 calls close to the top today. Do I sell when I break even on the trade or keep holding? Not used to these wild BA swings

Just bought 14 41$ calls on DKNG

#SELLONG CASH SECURED PUTS

C'mon WORK, you know you want to break 40 again.

If it looks too good to be true, it is...except for that $90 share of Boeing I bought in april when I didnt think we were at the bottom yet WHY DID ONLY BUY ONE?! YOU RETARD YOURE SO STUPID! STUPID!

NYSE says it will delist HTZ. Meanwhile it continues to pump.

>The New York Stock Exchange LLC (“NYSE” or “Exchange”) announced today that the staff of NYSE Regulation has determined to commence proceedings to delist the common stock of Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) — ticker symbol HTZ — from the NYSE.

>NYSE Regulation reached its decision that the Company is no longer suitable for listing pursuant to Listed Company Manual Section 802.01D after the Company’s May 22, 2020 disclosure that the Company filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In reaching its delisting determination, NYSE Regulation noted the uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of this process on the value of the Company’s common stock.

I just want 1 more large green dildo for AAL so I can cash out

The NBA confirmation news hasn't done much for DIS so got out of my **DIS 7/17 125c** x3 that I have been bag-holding for 14 days for a shitty $41 profit. I am so terrible about holding options that have been red and then turn green, I feel I just have to get out lest they tumble again. I know I should chance them since they are on the rise, but just can't face bag-holding.

Well my retarded ass missed out on 15 AAL $13 6/12 because I didn't set the limit price high enough this morning, now it's at +750%

How dumb is a $340c SPY 6/19 at $.06?

LK will be $10 bucks by next friday. Get your free tendies now

I got PFE $38 calls 7/17 so no it will be crashing to 30

*The NBA’s Board of Governors has voted to approve the league’s 22-team format to restart the 2019-2020 season in Orlando, source tells ESPN. -* I'm giving DKNG 1 hour to run up.. if it's flat I'm selling. what is everyone else's plays here

SPY 200p 9/18

GPS 1p 9/18

I put 50 bucks in jul 20 PLUG 6c this morning for fun thinking it would pump because of NKLA and a hydrogen hype. Only did 50 bucks because I don’t know shit about PLUG and thought it was a retard idea but wanted to have fun. Now I feel like an asshole for being right and up 400% on chump change. 

Can I borrow someone’s balls? I seem to have lost mine.

lol ninja please i got 6/5 920s... they were hella cheap and i was feeling frisky.... cashed out 2k on AAL this morning on a quick flip so whatever

Up $500 this week because i started buying SPY calls. Imagine that

Big money bought a bunch of CRWD calls from like 100 through 120. Unusual options created FOMO.

CZR $12.5c 6/19 ripping

Something VERY big is about to happen to GLUU. It's a 1B market cap stock with 150K volume on  11C 07/17

PICK THIS UP

I almost pull the trigger on ZM 215P awhile it was around 219 this morning but I decided against it because every other time I have tried to time a dip in ZM i have been run over. 

Today ZM didn't run me over, but it did splash me with a huge puddle as it drove by.

Spy 6/5 212c LEGO

ZM 160p saved

What did you think was being priced in when DKNG went from $20 to $45 lol

DGLY going to $15 by July. Protests are here to stay all summer and cops need cams. This is what happens when you quarantine 350 million people for 3 months everyone loses their jobs.

Last month I bought LUV at 25 and sold covered calls at 27.5 for 6/19. Now it’s 38.80.

look man one of the top rated posts on WSB is a DD post that just says SPY should be 500 because S&P 500 so what can you really expect from a bunch of fucking retards with 500 dollar portfolios

c'mon WFC BREACH 30 YOU CAN DO IT

Bought AAL stock at like 10 already up like 40%. Kinda sucks I bought it for the long term. Time to diamond hand

Stop asking like a child, look through the comments from the past 10 minutes and you'll get a pretty good indicator.  Sell now if you want to not go broke, currently holding calls on DKNG

$2 6/5 HTZ for a big gap up over night?

Same. I’m at 85 shares @ $3.03 average, my only regret was not buying more. That and EPR.

My dream would be to wake up tomorrow and see DOCU at 160, WORK at 50, MDB at 260 and PD at 40.  Too bad the probability of that is negative.

Just ned 10 more days like that for ZM

There's another 4 page post talking about illiquidity on NQ and the whole thing looks smart until you realize OP doesn't understand how NQ/ES and index ETFs work.

Lmao the 1 day CHWY chart looks like it fell off a cliff even though its still up 2%

bought 1 CZR call that's my lunch money

So I sell $CRWD at 93 and out of nowhere it shoots back up. Fuck post earnings I’m getting out at the lead up every time from now on, I can’t take this hahah

6/12 QQQ 230 Ps are really cheap still.. just a lil insurance that is all

CCL been fucking me for weeks.. just get over 20 already....

Is June 10 too soon for SPY calls

long dated DIS and MGM, 7/17 imo

SPY 320 by close?!?!

That AAL IV is seriously insane. The puts I picked up this morning when it first popped over 15 are now up 50%

guess who bought TSLA at 874 thinking it hit bottom

SPY can’t be red 2 days in a row can it?

Is June 12 SPY 312c fucked?

SPY 315c 6/5 I'm not scared

nah. It took Schwab almost 10 minutes to fill an order for NKLA this morning at open. and it filled at the absolute top. Lesson learned on not putting limit orders in lol

Here’s your chance on the MGM dip . 22 C will be printing by market open

Lol every time I post a sell under the ask for my FDX option some algo drops the previous lowest ask to $0.04 below mine for the same lot of 94 options

MGM about to rally to $22 EOD if it bounces off the floor

Are my FB calls for 7/2 that I bought yesterday ded?

It dropped down to test that previous 311 resistance. If it was gonna bounce it would do it immediately. But it chilled there half the day so most of the time that means its gonna keep going down barring any news to bring it back up. Also when you look at the NASDAQ it was very weak and riding a previous trendline all day and as soon as that gave away SPY tanked. It doesn't always work but keep an eye on all the different sectors

Where's that guy that said he just wrote 100 15p for AAL? You shittin yourself guy?

AAL will land somewhere between $20 and $25 tomorrow.

Ha ha I sold my BA calls at open for a 90% gain 15 min later they were up 350%. So of course I fomo’d back in later on the day and am down 70% on my fomo.

I have a few 6/5 $123 DIS calls I should have sold earlier, but alas, so autistically diamond handed them.  Should I sell today or hope for a rally tomorrow?  I know theta...

got some 6/5 BA 180ps, some 6/12 QQQ 235ps, ESTC from yesterday and WORK calls into earnings - those are both 7/17s ITM. gonna sit back and watch the show.. oh also SQQQ, SDOW, SPXS shares, $500 of each

SPY 07/17 350c

bro AAL will survive this last 45 minutes and rise 10% tomorrow easy

Got $F 7/10 6.5 this morning. Up 38%

Who tf recommended CRWD 110 6/12 calls?? Fuck you!

July 200 calls for MSFT are a good fucking deal. I’ve been swing trading these and getting 20-50% back a day.

Sold AAL $10c 6/5 last week...whoops

I want to thank the degenerate that suggested AAL 6/5 16C. You sir have single handedly taken my account from -4k to +17k.

PD / WORK easy money. 6/19 calls through earnings.

I'm yoloing AAL  6/19 4.50 puts because I like gambling

Sold AAL puts 40% profit in 10 mins. I cant be fucked fighting manipulation.

Excuse me SQ how you gonna give me +90% to down 55% in 2 hours

CASY has been all over the place today, got 1 c/230 11/20 thats bounced around all day. they're booming as a company compared to other gas stations

LMFAO to the idiots who held NKLA

15 billion company with no revenue

Lol, I love the idea that each MM has like 10 marks that they're in charge of screwing over.

ha I only had 1 day trade left so I sold my 6/5 call for $800, my other 2 AAL calls are going down now but not much I can do, I could sell 1 and be marked as a day trader. Rest of my calls are 6/19

$SPY going to 308 today if you want to scalp a daytrade. Out at 307.91.

JPOW only runs the printer 4 days out of the week.

I bought 100 $6 strike LK calls that expire tomorrow. Avg cost .10

I was up 2k earlier and almost closed out before I accidentaly used my last day trade getting rid of some shares. 

What will price have to open at in the morning for these to break even/be profitable?

ELON MUSK IS BACK ON TWITTER!  

TSLA 1500 6/5

Looks over at the first 10 years of TSLA....

Kay.

Just went all in on my favorite LEAPS. 

Now only two things can happen 

my RH theme turns green eventually 

OR I go to 0 but at least I will have 4-6 months to realize that pain

What, you got a problem with 310 all of a sudden SPY?

Stewart Butterfield just sent me a snapchat of his cawk. It was fucking HARD. 

&#x200B;

WORK 45C 6/19 THROUGH EARNINGS. FORGET IV.

Anyone see shiitload of volume for SPY puts expiry 11/20/2020. Buys at various levels SPY 240, SPY 205, SPY 275....The volume for SPY 240 is nuts. Hedge?

Dollar is at 2 month low, thanks JPOW

if you put in a limit order for BETZ at anything above $16 its gonna get filled I think

I closed half of my DAL and letting the rest go.  7/17 exp.

Another good entry point for DKNG if you're going 6/19 or later

Same. I always donate to kids with leukemia since I had it..I might dump another 500 this week if my plays hit a V shaped recovery

Sold MGM today for 110%, bought them ITM on Monday. Shoulda bought them OTM, could have tripled my tendies. Really sad.

So, to amend it, I took ALL of those tendies and put them into higher calls in hopes that this weekend will totally pop off. I mean, it's the weekend on reopening, dude. Get ready for tendies.

MGM 25c 7/17 now.

LOL, I played $350 in SMAR calls into $8.

TA say spy very overbought bruh, dangerous rn

wait for the pull back to 300 to buy in again

unless it breaks 312-314 resistance zone, then safe to buy bruh

Bought the dip, SPY $310c 6/30

Hold DOCU 155c 7/17??? Down 50%

BUD 60c 6/12 or 7/20

MASTER JP + NO LIMIT PRINTERS = SPY WILL NEVER LOSE 300 AGAIN

Do you dump DKNG 6/5 calls today or tomorrow

What you guys think of NKLA 40c 7/17

$ZM Puts  @ $200 June 12 

chances of these printing seem pretty good right now? what do you guys think?

Fuck my paper hands today. I sold my 6/5 313s because I was bleeding in the dip.... rolled into a 6/12 311c and I’m picking up steam again. All good though. JPOW POW POW GOT MY BACK

Get your SPY 400c 1/21 folks, best lottery ticket you'll buy.

Eod 07/17 calls SPY, AAL, BABA

Pump pump pump!

Sold my MU 48.5c 7/2 for over 100 percent today. Repositioned in again at the dip, 49c 7/2.

Flipped a DAL 34c 6/19 for over 70 percent gain!

Bought a 310c on Spy at the dip and already going up! 

Finally a solid green two days!

EBAY - 

Holy Hell - RSI just broke 100 - today has a big fat red candle going down.  Fundamentally strong company but that gap up from 45 - 51.  Wow.  Anyone else buying EBAY puts?

AAL is up 41%. You really think its going triple in 2 days? Probably not, wait and buy the dip.

BA 190 leggo

ORCL 55c 6/19 and PFE 40c 9/18, hop on the train gentlemen

Congrats to whoever just bought my SHOP 6/5 860c for .20 enjoy!

TSLA 6/19 calls down 70% fuuuuuuu

Watch SQ shoot up to 92 again tmw

Y’all might rag on shares, but let me tell you that nothing gets that trading fix going than after-hours trading ... followed by checking out your Aussie shares (AfterPay to $100 AUD, baby) starting at 8:00PM Eastern all the way until the pre-market opens.

I just yolod 10k into LUV 6/26 $40 calls pray for me

$DKNG TO $45 AH!!

Sold my MGM 20.5 Jul 2nd calls when it was trading for 21.70 at a 320% profit. Just bought back in with the gains at 22c for July second.  I'm an idiot prolly.

Yes. Got my first 1k+ off an initial sub $100 investment. It was STNE recent earnings.

AAL 6/5 CALLS kekw

20 mins and a $300 cushion to finally finish above $25,000. JPOW I NEED YOU BRO.

Any thoughts on TSLA calls EOD? I got 1 just now

SPY is hitting 320 tomorrow. 

Despite being red, more volume on up moves than down moves. Usually when this divergence happens there is a big move in the direction volume was pointing too.

NVDA refusal too sell off is amazing. 350 stuck

Anyone else buying JBLU $15c 6/19?

Going diamond hands and holding 10 40c 6/5 DKNG for a hard open tomorrow

GLUU FINNA PULL A ZYNGA CHECK THE CALL VOLUME ON 7/17 11C 
INSANE

Back to what?? Too low!! DKNG to $50 by tomorrow on news that NBA is turning into a rocket ship company and will broadcast space sports!!

AH i didnt see the 2019 your comment. I thought you meant yesterday june 3 2020. Okay yes that data is fucked but im up 27k on Sprit and 10k on LUV and just feels like the top of this fomo rally isnt in yet. will hold

Can anyone tell me how much msft Jun19 190 cslls are on another platform beside RH

A little short on cash, is AAL $20c too risky?

ENPH has just been tanking for no reason. Just crazy. Im down 95% on my $70c 6/19s

DRILL TEAM 6 BACK FROM SMOKE BREAK

Should I sell 10 BA stocks?

SPY 315c 06/12.

Hold BA 6/5 190 c overnight?

I have one contract because I'm short on funds ATM, thinking maybe buy 2 more.

Maybe BA puts, shit has been extremely overbought.  

I picked up 6/5 180s hoping for something around a 3 to 5 percent correction.

Hold or sell MGM July 20 21C? Ex-dividend date is 6/9, not sure what effect that has?

Watch my $0.35 DAL 6/5 $31p YOLO be my biggest winner of all time.

Portnoy learned about options today. Lucked out on some DAL calls. 

He's going to lose all his money within 9 months.

They have to be out of BK by June 30 to be eligible for government funding

I have LUV calls and would have sold 4 hours ago if not for elitist, classist PDT restrictions.

man I went from an $800 loss yesterday to gaining this back + $200 profit. TY NKLA

WORK 7/17 40C 35P

BA 6/19 150P

Thoughts?

Same, some guy agreed to meet me with $4200 cash for local pickup, handed me $4000, needed to wait for him to go to the ATM and get $200 out

BA 200 tomorrow. Buy some lottos

JBLU CHEAP calls for 6/19 boys, easy couple hundred

Yea lost 150 dollars on my calls 15 mins before my lunch break. Like cmon, you fucks! WE NEED TO GET THE DOW JONES UP!

My best guess is that tomorrow will be a repeat of today. $23 EOW.

Fast and loose with the last $100 left to my name aside from the $400 I made on SAVE 6/19 calls that my tp hands wouldn't hold on to.

going into tomorrow with 6/5 SPY 311c and 313c. Jerome, don't let me down!

MGM 7/17 calls last week was the right call :)

I got DIS 124c, DKNG 60c (I know this one hopeless), MGM 22c expiring tomorrow, about $1400 in total. DIS and MGM hitting should offset my DKNG loss. Green tomorrow!

hold BAC 6/19 26 C through close to tomorrow or take profits before close?

You almost certainly have a bunch of extrinsic value on those contracts. When market stops caring about MGM you'll lose some extrinsic value. There is a bunch of time left for your contract to mature, how valuable that time is depends on IV.

But ITM calls suffer least from IV crush since they have intrinsic value. On the other hand, you could roll your options onto an OTM strike to capture more delta for the same investment.

It's up to you, I'm holding MGM 22c 7/17 through next week.

All in on MGM $23c 6/19

I got 309 6/15 SPY puts and I aint fucking selling

When you see injustice in the world, it’s hard to not speak out. AMZN 2400p 6/5

Im holding fucking BA 185 & 190 calls that expire tomorrow overnight. Fucking yolo.

LVS $53c 6/19

AAL 15p 6/19

Sell my 6/5 DKNG calls ? I feel like I’m gonna get smacked in the morning if I hold them.

AAL says 12 Officers will leave the company soon. Rats are jumping ship. Puts.

BA 7/10 $195c free money

Closed out my puts on SPY and ZM, picked up a single $311c for giggles.

Just sold my last draftkings call. Last time couple times I unloaded calls, share price went up by about $5 and held within the next week. You’re welcome for $DKNG 45 next week

Yolo on SIMO 50c 6/19 and thank me later ;)

Tell me about it bro. Got shaken out of LULU puts earlier that would have made me like 2k. Lost 800 instead. Swell...

DOCU 190 07/17

sell TWTR 6/19 35c or wait for morning pump

Is late june WORK calls (40c 6/26) a good option?

AAL 15.5c 6/5 are up 17000%

Which of you fuckers had some?

iM so FUCKING pissed I sold my AAL 12c 6/12 yesterday, that's like $300 i missed out on

5 DKNG 43 c 6/5. Pray for me

160k volume on GLUU 11c 7/17 and 160k volume on SNAP 21c 10/16

Is this buffet

just picked up JBLU 9/18 24C

PTON 6/12 50c
TSLA 6/12 1000c
SAVE 6/19 25c
DKNG 6/26 45c
BA 11/20 300c

Let’s go

Webull you can have a cash account. So you can day trade up to your balance unlimited. So say 1k balance, you can day trade spy puts for 200, up to 5 times a day. The thing is, it takes the next day to settle. So it’s limiting, but at the same time, so much more freedom than RH. RH limit has cucked me so many times, “oh now I have to hold” or “I don’t want to use this day trade”, pretty much forces you to swing trade which is stupid

SPY ends green today.  Has 1 minute.

5 6/5 $14 AAL puts coming right up

DKNG went up 40 cents today. That means if it goes up 40 cents per day until the end of time, it will eventually be worth lots of money.

DKNG 69,420 EOY confirmed.

AMZN 3000 EOW

JBLU 9/18 24C will print

Alright everyone, see you at SPY 315 open tomorrow

bye!

Got some sexy WFC 30.5c 6/5 at market close.  


It's been a while since I've gotten calls expiring the next day. Good luck to all of those that did the same today!  


Pencil dicks down!

Got some of them 6/5 ZM puts

Portfolio down 80% over the last week. I spend my last money on 6/5 DAL puts (30, 31, and 32 strike) just before close. Will I make it back or am I fucked?

I sold SPY $306c for $316 and DIS $120c for $185 Wednesday morning. Both exp tomorrow. Profits, yes. But FUCK. And today I'm stuck with FB and AAPL with diamond hands.

NERV shot up like 30 cents and my call is still worth the same amount wtf

where's that dude that spent $25k on SHOP $850c 6/5

Nice.  Grats.  I got some of that GE love too.  Been holding these $9 9/18 calls for a while.

Wish I woulda bought more calls as i averaged the drops on SPY. Easier to diamond hand when you’re only playing with 40 contracts instead of like 100.

Sold my AAL 13c for 300% profit still moving up damn paper hands.

Why does RH show that I went down $720 pre-market? I was holding NKLA options overnight btw

Fucking DOCU. Was up $300 ended down $60. Not sure how I’ll ever survive the trauma

GE $8 6/12’s gonna print crispy tendies

Bout to post my 1 AAL 12c 07/17 to /r/antstreetbets when I get home.

My crowning achievement.

scalped HTZ puts for easy 20% gain in like 20 minutes, saving my portfolio from red today

Airlines went to the moon today. Cruise ships also got a big boost. But you know, with all these travel industries going up, do you know where these people are going?

THAT'S RIGHT, STRAIGHT TO FABULOUS LAS VEGAS BABY

MGM 25c 7/17

Oops.  Was too slow closing my 6/5 MET 40c's at close.  Hope she keeps going up over night lmao

Who the fuck is buying SPY in insane amounts during the last 30 min everyday

I am memeing I’ve been long $BA since 95 so I don’t need to work again

Dude why, just buy calls, up 60% on DAL 32C 7/17 i got this AM. There is literally not a better way to burn money

WORK ABOUT TO MOON BOIS.  


3 AM LOCAL TIME FOR ME FOR EARNINGS. WAKING UP TO A NICE SURPRISE.

I FOMO into a BA $180 Call. Why?

Holding DIS, MGM, LUV, and F long calls. AKA I’m printing money while bears desperately hope for even a slight dip in the market to make 3 percent returns

I can't wait for AAL to hit 20 tomorrow

Fuck it. MGM 6/12 $25c
