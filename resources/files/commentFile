It has only been teasing but those 7/17 $50 calls are gonna pay.

Honestly, if 9/11 didn�t bring us together long term, nothing ever truly will. Everyone has to do better as people. Even those oppressed. It�s the only way we can get there. And by there, I of course mean SPY 420c 1/15/21

The open interest on Spy 9/18 $5 puts is 5,000. 

Jesus Christ you autists

Check the open interest on 6/19 puts (300, 290, 280, 270, 260, 250 strikes) 

Fucking graveyard man

Check the open interest on 6/19 puts (300, 290, 280, 270, 260, 250 strikes) 

Fucking graveyard man

How�s your 6/5 $220 call looking? Fucking moron

Check the open interest on 6/19 puts (300, 290, 280, 270, 260, 250 strikes) 

Fucking graveyard man

vitals seem fine hes about 6/15 on the cognitive function scale though. His mind is gone but his poor heart keeps trying

How�s your 6/5 $220 call looking? Fucking moron

yep! 7/17 $17c's

Narrator: Twas not enough for his 6/5 140c

same here.. gonna buy more on dip.. what strike expiration? im 7/17 95Cs

Same. At least it�s green. 7/2 $50c

MGM 18.50 6/5 call turning into CASH

I have two 6/5 95c, may get bold and sell both buy more at the initial dip

I hope so, I�m holding 6/12 $21 calls

I wish I hopped on LULU earlier, and with more money. The bid/ask spread is pretty wide, volume is low and premium is high, but it goes up like 5 bucks everyday. I'll hold my 6/5 300c till the end.

I'm honestly surprised more people on WSB haven't been playing LULU

should i dump my 310c 6/5 or hold them into tomorrow?

APPS calls 7/17 $9

APPS calls 7/17 $9

I�m still holding my 6/19 calls

My 6/3 310$ calls actually gonna print wow

Dump out of my DIS 125 6/12 calls at open if we hold 119.8?

Where are 310c 6/5 opening? closed at $1.54 yesterday but futures up 20 pts... I bought yesterday at $1.15...

Asking myself same question... I might sell my 6/5 calls and keep my 7/2 calls

But I'm down about 40% over last 2 weeks so inverse me

Sell those 6/5 and take them profits, brother. Let those 7/2 ride!

Same, was up 200% and now up only 15%. Still kicking myself but I have a 6/19 exp

My calls are for 7/19 o think I have to hold?

If I get to 100% profit I may bow out go get my tendies

Sell my SPY 07/17 307c today or wait till end of week? Or hold till expiration? Lmao

Yext calls, 6/19 20c

What do you mean ? Like 07/17 315c ?

Selling these SPY310 6/3 calls at open. Can't believe I was dumb enough to hold them overnight and now they're actually ITM

And to think I bought 6/3 308c when spy was at 305 yesterday.

I'm just going to let my 6/19 puts expire worthless and hang on to the 2K i have left. Down 60% overall, it was frankly just funny money I had left over in my brokerage and have a well paying job that will have it all back in a month so ultimately I'm ok. Gotta just sit cash because I can't believe all this going up when my entire city was looted to shit this past week. So anyway I'll be buying some SPY 270 puts tomorrow I'm sure.

My 6/26 28.50 WFC may print...

Buy DKNG 6/19 $50c at open

Holy shit spy is actually 310. My 6/12 307c I bought yesterday are gonna fucking print

actually, it was a 11/20 200 call. so deep in the money I'm gonna jizz

DD: CCJ is undervalued, uranium prices are high rn, company is Canadian so safe from crazy Americans. If you google CCJ you see lots of good stuff. Stock will go up even more as China increases uranium usage. Which they will as tensions increase so they look strong.  

TLDR: stonks only go up CCJ 12$c 12/18

*disclaimer* I started trading last month an learned everything I know from WSB

Yes, take whatever profit. Or roll to 7/17 125c

my 4/20 200c will print any day now

Should I roll out 6/12 SDC calls? 6% profit rn but in worried I�m going to miss their run up by being too early

these $SPY calls are retarded, $330 6/12 call bought yesterday, sold for 60% profit this morning. This market makes no sense.

My spy 310c expires 6/12 and at this rate it�ll be up 500% by next week

not much difference between being too early and completely wrong. Just ask my 5/29 40c on $WORK

So I had CRWD 6/5 $100C, and had a limit order up for $5 on open, and my heart sank a bit on open.  Then it sold a minute later.  So that ended up being a little profitable (I paid too much for it, and should've doubled down on the dip yesterday).

Didn't like the spreads on Jan calls so I ended up getting a few 60 9/18s. Bought them 5/29 and am up 104% so far

Bought more $5 MIK 6/19 calls for earnings in the morning.

Are we selling our 7/2 BUD calls or what?

I�m waiting for the mid-morning selloff (normally 2 1/2 hrs from open) to grab some FD calls

Closed out my 6/3 spy 310 calls, looks like jut in time

Yea my expiry is 11/20 so I�m good

once these SPY 6/3 308Ps hit 20 cents a contract I'm all in baby

Holy fuck I just bought 50 6/5 AMD 52p and now realized I don�t have any day trades left.

MU 7/2 $60c thank me later

Damnit the iv crush on these dkng puts is such bullshit. Bought 6/19 35s two days ago at the peak and still down 10% give me my fucking money

Yo I�m insulted at the bid ask spread for my 11/20 $55 RTX call. Up to $65 now, so I�m $1K ITM with 5 months to go, and current bid is $1,030. Fuck off haters, this thing is going to the 90�s by then.

1.7m in 7/2 290 SPY puts today from someone

Same here.  Spy 6/3 307c. Being an addict I�m looking for something to put it all back into...

CLDR 7/17 $12.5c. Cheap loto ticket.

Most people probably have 6/5 expiration.

I bought 6/5 309p SPY so naturally it will hit 315 EOD

CLDR earnings today. Been riding this up since sub-$8. Printed like crazy. Sold off 2/3 of positions up to today - question is - do I sell off the remaining third or ride through earnings? Huge candle and volume this morning tells me to hold.

M 6.5p 6/5 fucking go down :(

I'm the retard who bought 7700 worth of DKNG 6/5 50c yesterday and instantly went down 3600. Sold at open for only an L of 2600. I'm ok with that. I'm gonna jerk off and do the sleepy drugs now

Reloaded 7/17 puts, everyone�s calls are safe for the next month you�re welcome

AMD sips on the sweet tears of all of its 6/5 55c holders

100% return on FXI plays yesterday. Sold told and dumped it all into 6/12 $43c.

Looking to exit mid day to tomorrow morning

My 6/19 calls are scared

DIS broke 120....Was my 120c 7/17 a good move???

My whole account is riding on MU 7/17 50 calls. Am I going to be rich? Serious inquiry.

What�s the beat thing to put my 2500 on. I�m thinking spy 6/19 320

Is it time to panic sell DKNG 7/17 calls?

CLDR is a steal right now get on it 6/19 13C is so cheap

Hold or sell $DIS calls through thursday?  

DIS 7/17 125c

What strike? 7/17 is far out enough.

This shit is crazy. I love that the market is irrationally going up, but there has to be a rug pull at some point. Q2 earnings are just around the corner and GDP is going to be an absolute shit show. How the fuck are we going up? 

Positions:   
Moving entire 401k into cash fund till I arbitrarily decide to move it back into the market. I hope it's not due to FOMO.  
MOMO 21.5 c 6/19 <- DON'T DO THIS, good DD, but gyna  
SPY 285p 6/10 <- Maybe, I hope were red tomorrow, I'd take break even on a small dip  
PCG 15c 9/18 <- Are long dated even accepted on WSB?  
WTFC 40c 12/18 <- These have been printing steadily the last few weeks. Bought at the absolute bottom.

My spy 6/19 321s all doubled today

im holding, 7/17 is a ways to go

AVGO 6/5 300C = PRINTING earnings tmw come ride the train and CIEN 6/12 56C also earnings tmw premarket

I�m holding 55c 6/19 and 60c 7/17

I have 115x 6/5 $40 VTIQ calls. They are currently about one sixth the value what they were yesterday morning.

Never lost this much in 24h.

Pretty afraid of this not working out.

Yeah same CCL $10 6/19 yup this must be it

 DKNG 42C 6/5 if you want to make a little $

KR 6/19 37C

How long we holding MGM? I�m up 100% already on my 7/17 calls

Got a cheap MGM call this morning at open. 7/10 21.5c -- already up 56%. Gonna get more. Vegas is gonna be back to normal in a few weeks.

got 2 10C 6/19 at $0.75

The premium on 2021 puts is astronomically high. 100% falling before the end of the year, my 7/2 $175p�s hope it�s soon

Work 40c 6/5 come print with me.

I've started to slowly offload my 6/19 $10Cs and $11Cs, holding some $12.5C 7/17s in case it pops after earnings.

Sold my 6/19 $17 DXC calls for a cool 130%. Should have held onto some of them though, since I sold right before it went ITM. It's chilling around 17.40 now.

AVGO 6/5 300C = PRINTING earnings tmw come ride the train and CIEN 6/12 56C also earnings tmw premarket

Balls deep in PYPL calls 6/19 cheap as fuck

I have two 6/19 35c WORK calls. Should I just exercise the options and buy the 200 shares? If so when?

You owe me an answer after forcing me to buy SPY calls last month early.

TSM is popping off, semiconductors are continue to moon TSM 53c 6/12 undervalued

BUD 55c 6/19 still time to get in folks

ENTG 6/19 60c printing

I sold CSPs on 7/17 $35p DKNG for $2.90.

Yeah its not looking good...

Glad i went in with 7/17 spreads, imma wait it out and see.

Anyone wanna buy some 6/3 40c on VTIQ?

UAL $35c 6/12 about to soar. Huge green dildo today. Hit $2 on open last week when it was up like this the day before. At least double your money when it opens green tomorrow.

Dunno but I bought some $300 7/17 calls before earnings and they about to start printing.

Do I sell my MGM 7/17 $25c for 110% or hold through openings?

My 6/19 SPY 250p still good? Lol jk

Diamond hands the move with ZM or take that 40
Percent hit.

190p 6/12 and 7/17 200p

Thinking of cutting losses right now but really thought there�d be more profit taking and pullback today

My dumb ass can�t bring myself to sell my 6/19 zm puts, fuck it chuck it football

I'm in. 7/17 $12c

I just bought a 6/12 44c, going straight retard today.

I've gotten hungry and started snacking on crayons. Red is my favorite but blue makes my poo funny colors. Also I'm holding $SPY 350C 7/17 for .19.

And 6/19 DKNG calls holders holding for a recovery?

Are 6/5 Itm MGM calls a hold until expiration? Already up 150%.

Buying the 6/19 was honestly a mistake (turned out to be a good buy). I meant to buy 7/17s. I still have one 7/17 that I am letting ride. It just crossed the 100% mark. I would unload some just in case earnings do some unexpected shit with it.

My 6/19 185c would like to know that as well

How about 6/19 expiry

Sold off 6/19 holding 7/2

CHWY 6/19 60C

MGM 6/26 20C gang

Good resistance at 39 for WORK. 45c for 6/5 who is with me.

Holding 6/12 $50c hoping to break even then dip.

I have MGM 20$ calls for 6/19 should I hold through reopening?? 

Or is this the top now.

Man, I don't want to unload this DELL put I bought right after the earnings run up but it's hurting my gains! I'm thinking a nice market pull back would bring it down into profit but It has to happen soon and DELL seems to have some strength.

06/19 $47.50p

Fuck, I have 6/5 expirys so I am looking at an exit. If I can get it back at 41 i might jump out and look for another entry

I�m selling 6/19 and buying later dates. July/august

MARK 7/17 $5c

Am I crazy for WORK 6/5 38p.  I get it�s a great company and everyone�s WFH and using it. But it seems overvalued.

holding my DKNG 6/12 $45 calls with diamond hands. going down with the ship if I have to.

Bought 7/17 BUD $50c, then added $60c, now just added $70c. $70 is probably way too wishful, but this keeps having 5% days.

**BUY FCEL! 3c 6/19** seems to be the popular one  


\- Earnings: 6/8 (will sell before earnings bump)

\- lots of room for movement

\- breaking out of its current channel because of earnings

\- top 100 on RH, top stocks under $25 on RH

I am holding **FCEL 3.5 7/17**

GAN 6/19 $22.5c baby

I have a WFC 8/21 32.5C. I am already up 105%. I know I  have until August but Idk if i should take profits and not get greedy. Should I sell or not?

they have a lot more upside even at 7.  this isnt a bet though, i want those GNUS 15c 7/17 but no options...

$SPG 6/19 75 c. DONT SLEEP ON THIS

AMD 6/12 53C seem like the easiest play but that probably means it's a terrible idea.

Got filled this morning on RTX 65c 6/5 for .39. Am I the autist for not canceling or the person who didn�t cancel their sell?

it was cool selling my $TTD 6/19 call for 35% gain, but now it's sitting at about a 350% gain. guh

Sold my 6/5 DIS calls and it moons exactly 30 seconds later.  Welp.

Are DKNG 6/19 45c properly fucked now?

Holding 18 6/5 305p. How can I sell these off?

Awesome DD on STWD the other day. +132% on my 7/17 17.5 calls

Pull up the weekly chart on DKNG.... Not even the 1M, or the 6M. Look at the 5 day chart. This is nothing. This is a healthy dip on the ride up above $50.



R-E-L-A-X



I know this concept is foreign to you losers, but it's called "Buy low, sell high". This is where you **BUY** DraftKings, not panic sell it.

Pour into 6/19 $50c and start picking out your yacht. Come back to this comment and express your gratitude in a couple weeks.

Sold my 6/3 308 calls at $310.70

Took my initial investment and moved it into SPYD.

Rolled out profits to 6/5 312s bought at average price for the day and added an extra contract.

I�m in with you! 6/19 75c!

Whoever taking my advice on SPG, i got another ten bagger for yall. MRVL, dont sleep on this. Get in while its cheap. Buy a 7/2 expiration any strike.

went all in at open finnally. its time for the finance sector to pop. JPM $115 7/17 and...i also went in on BUD 7/17 $60

SPY calls 06/12 but you gotta hold through a dip.

Fomo�d back into mgm 6/5 21c got out +88%! Might regret not holding ..again

That's why I bought some 6/18 puts on Swedistan.

AVGO 6/5 300C = PRINTING earnings tmw come ride the train and CIEN 6/12 56C also earnings tmw premarket

Buying SPY 6/5 309p was not the move today

Holy crap...my 30 buys of MGM 6/19 22c May actually hit!

SCO 1/3 of way to spelling WSB

My MGM $20c 6/19 about to be ITM with my $18s too

What positions you have? I�ve got 7/2 $50c I�m holding on to.

Imagine not buying $BUD calls, it's the most American thing to do. Drink beer, watch stonk go up, save the economy.

9/16 $60c

7/17 $50c

6/19 &50c

This is the cold streak. Sold my BA calls for small gains before today. Bought ZM puts like a moron.

Still up a little from the DKNG run up but pretty much around breaking even.

My ZM
200p is at least 7/17 but it�s bleeding a lot

Wow, there are actually people buying ZM 6/5 $150p's today still.  WTF?

Buy $KR 7/17 $33/$34/$35 calls if $KR drops below $32.00, you will be profitable. free fkin money

Wasn�t expecting my 7/17 MGM $20c to hit so soon. Sell or hold for another week or two?

AAL $12.5c 6/12 pretty cheap for how close it is. Probably will hit $15 by then. Riots in the streets for like a week and no wave 2 in sight. I don't even think it would matter.

got 120 C for 6/12 so i hope it goes up bigly pls

Fuck it, fuck it fuck it fuck it. I�m yoloing into VTIQ 50c 6/12 at $0.23 a pop. DKNG and ZM have taken everything away from me, and there�s nothing more dangerous than a man with nothing to lose. I�ll see you lads on the other fucking side.

thoughts on buying a couple ZM 205-210 6/5 puts?

Not sure what play to make here.


My 01/21 MGM leaps (20, 23, 25) are up over 100% each. 


Sell to buy shares or just hold until closer to expiry?

VTIQ 40c 7/17 checking in

If my 6/5 $45 DKNG call doesnt hit im gonna snort fentanyl and die high as balls

I have SPY calls 280c, 295c that expires 6/26 and 300c that expires 6/30, and they have been printing money but should I keep holding unto them??

NOK 4 8/20 about to print massively hurry up

I have a 10/16 $40c WFC that's still under, but it's a lot closer than it has been in about a month.  (I was thinking with Fed injection they'd be pulling in big revenues on consumer/business loan interest)

Same here. 6/19 give me more hope than of i were holding 6/5 but still down 40%. Let's do it baby

i'm in for 6/19 $34 but severely overpaid, hope i can recover some of it during the earnings run up

80% return on ba 157.5 call exp 6/12 bought today. Damn when shud I sell this

My 6/26 322c would be very happy

Imagine how my $20 6/19 feels. Wish I grabbed more. Was tempted to sell at the top just now, but held. Hope it keeps going.

Question is how long do I hold these MGM calls? Might just be hype that they're opening tomorrow. Expiration is 6/19 but up a little over 100%

Let�s do it, GLD 6/19 162c - count me in for about 3 contracts lol

Stop, you're getting my 6/5 $41.50 puts too excited!

4.5 cody 6/5 calls seem cheap for being so close to the money

MGM 6/26 25c is the way!!!

airline and hotel industries retard 7/17 UAL $45

back to my bear habits. 6/5 310p take me to valhalla

Do I continue to hold my MGM 6/12 calls? Made a nice chunk of change this morning.

Need this moment to continue through the day for casino stocks. 6/5 12c :/

Holding 6/19 35c. At a 50% loss. Should I keep holding or cut losses and run

$17.22. Spot price was approximately $233 at that time. 

I sold 6/19 $210p calendar spreads for $1.36 at a spot price of about $230.

Sold SPY 311 3/15 just like 10 min too early

FCEL 3c 6/19 you poor

MGM 9/18 20 calls are cheap

My shit is being retarded, I'm just curious, how much were SPY 6/3 310Cs worth at the start of the day yesterday?

I'm up 200% on my 7/17 $25.

I've got 20x 09/30 55c

Too scared to look at the price action atm cus my paper hands always sell too early

If you play the Theta on DKNG, 11/20 40p are 11.00 right now. Puts you at a price point of 29.00.

Throwing the last of my account $25k into 6/5 TSLA $850 puts. They have been hovering at 2.00/contract all morning

CHWY 6/19 55c, won't be surprised if it dips tomorrow as well. I got shaken out of my CRWD, ESTC, and DOCU the other week by two days of hard dumps.

i got 6/26 and 7/10 calls....worth holding? this is tough to look at

Strike and exp? I had some 7/1 300s I got Monday but sold off half. I am gonna be pissed if we dump next week

SPY 6/12 316c? Why not

AVGO 6/5 300C = PRINTING earnings tmw come ride the train and CIEN 6/12 56C also earnings tmw premarket

There's huuuge volume on CNK 7.5p for 9/18

If AMC has "substantial doubt", I have *extreme* substantial doubt CNK can stay in business

Bought 4 DFS 40c 7/17 for $275 each way back when it was at $37 range. Sold 3 in the 1000-1200 range. Last contract around 1750 now. Sell last one or keep holding?

threw a fuck ton of money on LUV 6/12 $39 calls out of spite from my DKNG rape, this shit finna hit or what

No idea. It�s 60c 7/17 so I guess I�ll hold? 6 negative percent days in the last 7 days... such a joke

SPY 305p 6/5 are free money

Spy 7/17 335c this things not stopping who�s with me?

So why do SPY 12/18 363/364c have open interest of 250,000+

43c 6/12 I am fuk

Yolo on zm 6/5 230c. It�ll print on Friday morning.

i sold my 6/5 311 calls for 80% profit today, that extra 20-30% truly isnt worth the high blood pressure/lack of sleep LMAO

Honestly i plan on holding the 6/19 dkng calls I have in full dumb dumb mode so this helps me to not look at the absolute beating I'm taking today

Earnings after the bell... I�m just waiting for a spike.  I don�t think I�m holding through.  I have 6/5 calls.

SPY 350C 7/17 fight me.

Buying a 6/12 395c

DKNG $49 6/19  you think I'm good?  I'm down a decent amount right now..

NCLH $19c 6/12 and 6/19 are cheap

CHEF 7/17 17.5C = TENDIES

24 hours ago I bought 6/8 $311c when they were $6 otm. Now they�re itm. This is the October-February market all over again

To think I almost sold my MGM 07/02 25C yesterday at a loss to get in on the DKNG dip...

Guess I'm glad I caught RTX at 63 yesterday for that 6/5 $65 riggity rebound

CZR 6/12 12.50 calls are still only 0.10

F stalled....

7/17 5.5p

so double down on my 6/19 42c even though I'm down 30%

$7.8 Million into spy 07/02 290 Puts in 3 orders. Each above the ask. Possibly a hedge.

Yestedays EOD 06/03 spy 310Cs worked like a charm.

probably not if it goes to 25 by next month.   But look at others, LVS is up bigly today, 1/3 of their business is Vegas.  RRR and BYD are worth looking at too.  They are more local-ish casinos off the strip but I think that benefits them in a way

I am.  I have 6/5 11.50c.  Lets hope it pops after earnings

Ight boys- chewy 7/17 $60 calls locked and loaded. Chewy is to wayfair as wayfair is to amazon. LETS GET THIS BREAD

Been saying that for weeks bro. I'm in for 310 calls 6/22 and I feel fantastic.

All in spy 304p 6/5 go

Holding ZM puts through 6/19 idgaf that pos is gonna crash

PFE 6/5 37c do i cut my loses now or stay in?

What's the feeling on ESTC? Earnings after hours tomorrow...been flat since Monday.  Should I hold or cash out up %80

&#x200B;

Got 6/19 $80C and $90C.

Sold my BABA 210c 6/5 on Monday for $2.10 AMA

I�d say just sell an lock profits, but hold an option or two just to see what happens. I picked up a 6/19 100c today just to see what happens

Very tight stops this morning. Some hit a d cashed out some still riding. I got antsy with too many green candles so ZM 6/5 200p ZOM 6/5 47p SPG 6/19 55p

So hold onto my 7/3 25c?

Dis 130c 7/17 printing bigly

Because we have powered straight above 3100 so we can have a drill and gap down. Then a slide into Friday. We�re on an expiration date and everyone is tilted. Vix has been slaughtered the last few days and the banks need the vol for profit so we�re at the lower bound for this range move. Let�s get this money. (Still stacking more toward 6/12 just in case)

PLAY $15.5 Call 6/19

Get in quick! This thing is skyrocketing!

Then get out quick, Dave and Busters sucks!

NOK 7/17 5c get in while it's cheap

Holding 6/19 15c through earnings for fun

Finally learned my lesson to sell early today (DIS, MGM).  Unfortunately its the one day everything decided to run.  Oh well, still holding my BA 160C 8/21 and SPY 105C 7/17 which continue to print

Surely there is no way that my SPY 300p ~~5/31~~ ~~6/30~~ ~~9/30~~ 12/31 won't pay me handsomely.

The mouse is on the move!  7/17 $130c checking in.

Yooo sell 121 6/5 Dis c or ride til Thursday's announcement?

Like when I sold my DLTR 6/19 85c for $1.25 a week before earnings

Up 120% on 6/8 310C

Sell or hodl

Bought into 7/17 5c yesterday, let's gooo

Hmm up 100% on DIS 6/19 120c... Kinda want to keep holding through this week though

45c 6/19 here... only down 76% now...

I did it, I bought a 6/5 $313 put. Fuck this, it can�t go up forever. Just pull back a buck or two for fucks sake

i know i'm sweating it, small fortune riding on $45 6/26 calls

I have been holding ba 9/18 200c for a month and after today's pop I'm thinking about readjusting my positions. I wanna hold ba. Thinking to get more in the money but sooner expression to lock in some profits. Trying to get any suggestions

Should I get out of my 6/5 DKNG calls now or wait until tomorrow

AVGO 6/5 300C = PRINTING earnings tmw come ride the train and CIEN 6/12 56C also earnings tmw premarket

Can't believe I've done this again... SPY 309p 6/10 - redeem meee

Lol 6/5 310s here bro, let�s go

I have $115 11/20 ZM puts, how worried should I be?

ZM 6/19 puts gonna print

Hold Dis 6/5 120c?

Up almost 100% on MGM calls. They�re 7/17 so I might hold

Donkey Kong will make a run back up.. unless your calls exp 6/5 then who knows.

Got 6/12 got a bit of time

I�m 6/12 $12c myself up a little over 60% feels like I should be smart and sell. It�s only 10 contracts tho

Current positions

YEXT 20C 7/17
MU 75C 7/17
KR 37C 6/19

Right, but these are all new deaths ON TOP of all the people who normally die. Was 9/11 also a scam because the flu kills more people?

Daytrading this shit is like trying to squeeze water from a stone. Got some 06/12 calls and puts gonna go enjoy my life.

Trim your position. 34 is resistance. I have 1/4 of my original position and letting them ride

F about to close its 3/5 gap

Man I'm trying so hard to diamond hands my 6/19 $20 calls for MGM right now. So tempted to cash out -\_-

At 2pm I am putting my last thousand dollars into 6/3 308ps

the're still going to go up. I sold my 6/5 and then opened 21.5 6/5. I'll either close eod or tomorrow

#TODAY IVE BECOME A FULL GAY BEAR

I'm dumping all of my life savings - 79k into spy 9/18 265p

The stock market WILL pop. And it WILL be glorious

Sold my BA 190c 6/19 for +347%.  Probably gonna be upset if i couldve made more.

I sold my 40c for as much as I'd made on monday... Do I dare buy back in to 6/5 35c on speculation NKLA stems the bleeding...?

JP Morgan, BA, or MGM calls 6/5 expiration

So glad I went all in on spy 310 7/10 a couple days ago. The question is when to sell

BA 150p 6/5 just gonna buy one for fun since its just $20 per contract

diamond handing that shit to the end

7/17 never forget.

Nothing like selling my 6/3 309 spy calls for 0.60 right before the big green dick yesterday through today.

Hold 19.50 6/26 MGM calls?

Took my profits on DIS 7/17 125C at $4. Last time I didn't do that I ended up with a loss.

53c 6/12 up 70% since this morning

What�s the play with a Disney 7/17 call?

Must be. I bought 7/17 65c

GRPN 7/17 1.5 calls still a bargain IMO. Before we see a corona spike, businesses are gonna be putting out deals to recoup lost sales.

I'm holding my 7/17 $130c - but I have no idea what I'm doing

They are announcing some movie coming out on Disney+ on the 5th. I�d say you have a 4% chance of it reaching 125 by then. 

My current position: DIS 9/18 130c

Wait for DAL or SAVE to dump then buy 7/17 calls

Already in 6/19 50c's

Rtx recovering from a few days of losses, glad I bought the dip, my 62x 6/19 70c up 121% today

I bought a $SPY 211c 6/12 for $3.30 and it is now hovering around $6.60.

Should I lock in 100% gains or wait some more?

So my MS 6/19 $55c have a chance?

I still believe. 7/17 expiration. Holding.

Cashed out my 6/5 $160 BA up 360% fuck it nice win on to the next one

I grabbed 20 SPY 310p 6/5

I usually lose money on this stuff though so don't follow me

I bought today when I dipped to $39. 6/12 $45c, not too worried. Wish I held on a bit the MGM tho

Me too. Down $14k from this time yesterday. Always get too cocky, go all in and then anally raped. 10/10 will do it again.

Pricing in is based on certainty. People are 90% sure the NBA will happen so 90% is priced in. It will go up but not pop.

Cali opening up to betting will pump the stock. I think 80% of that news is priced in. 20% uncertainty.

Either way I believe in DKNG. My position: 8/21 55c

lmao you know shit is retarded when itm calls are down on the day.  Zoom 6/5 220 is still red after a 7% climb LOL

I bought some 10k of 6/15 SPY 310C at the top, you're welcome

Sitting on my 6/26 $25 calls and watching them march up the charts.

Just got a 6/5 165-170c spread off this comment.

Also bought some SPY 6/8 312P just in case

UCO bull put spreads 20/25 7/17

Bought a 7/17 160 when BA was like 147.  Sold it yesterday for a modest gain thinking �lock gains lock gains� 

Got out when DKNG was 42 and I bought in pretty early.  Then got cocky and stupid and went deep in ZM puts.

Of course sold my mgm calls too, and my spy 305c for a baby gain instead of what it is now.

But still I got stupid lost patience and got emotional. Sucks but overall I left with more than I started. Gonna chill cash and do more research. Because that was like 6 bad moves in a row.

Good luck!

10k 6/18 310C SPY
2k 6/8 312P SPY
can't go tits up right

$GWRE setting up for $115 after hours tonight, $12.5k loaded into 7/17 $105 calls. HERE WE GO

About $1.5M in 7/17 IWM 139p coming in.

A little bit of SPY 316c for next week, but not much.

ZM calls 7/17 300. dont fight the retarded strength of this stock

SPXL calls obviously the move. Breakeven on 07/17 calls is only $4 away. Would be more profitable to wait for a dip, but Im jacked to the tits with calls.

Ok I'm in 8/21 75 and 77.5

ZM 6/5 200p I feel retarded already

it's overbought like a motherfucker right now, can probably get in for cheaper if you wait for the right time. That being said I'm all in on 45 7/17 calls because i can't take my own advice.

Sold my 6/3 $310c�s at open:/

Waiting for the Spy 298 6/5  shit post today

Sold my 6/12 310c�s at open :/

Lost a bit on zm puts. Fuck it, I�m buying the dip with DKNG, VTIQ, and Roku calls. I�m an asshole. Also got some Yext 6/19 17.5c

Anyone have any idea why ECL 6/12 290c has such a crazy high amount of volume? ECL is trading at 220 right now so it doesn�t seem remotely plausible.

Just shipped on $54 6/19 although I�m still anticipating another drop today. Whatever I�ll just average down. Let�s go Su!

Oof sold zm 230 calls for 6/5 and I�m starting to get nervous

People gave me shit for buying calls on Coca Cola saying it's a boomer stock and that it won't move....  


My 50c 7/17 calls are up 60% in a week lol

Anyone feel like tomorrow�s late day play is 6/5 312p for Friday morning?

I got Spy 315c�s 6/12 and the rest cash. Let see how this plays out

my spy 306c 9/30 finally in the green

Got some 6/5 $308 Puts. I'm gonna sell first thing Thursday morning regardless of how it opens.

I think I'm just gonna grab 6/5 115s lol, how bad an idea is that? I believe they will too though.

i have 7/17 95Cs from last night and 7/17 100Cs from this morning and 6/19 100Cs from just now.. shit is down and im not liking it. ut am and will be holding

Pretty please my 6/12 315 calls would fucking love that.

Did you buy 6/5 calls?

Half on vxx 6/5 38c and half Uber 6/5 37c lol

I have several 6/12 and 6/19 calls 6 and 6.5 strikes. Already up 22% since getting in this morning. Definitely not too early

UNFI 6/19 22.5C

Earnings 6/10

235 and 240 calls 6/19 
So I still have time but I'm getting frustrated lol

God no 6/19 calls which gives me more time still but :(

Still holding dis 120c 7/17 (+45%) and mgm 20c 7/17 (+115%). Starting to get toilet paper hands

i got $39 6/12 calls godspeed

15x SPY 312c/314c ds exp 06/10

15x SPY 308p exp 06/10

SPY 315c exp 06/12

I'll see u after lunch

Depends on timeframe, DKNG WILL see a surge before sports events open, it's gonna dip in the meantime, so if it's a 6/21 then cash out but if long term hold it

How�s 7/17 sound?

Down 50% on my ZM puts. Value has actually gone up since beginning of the day thanks to increased IV. Still see more upside than down, engaging diamond hands.  7/2 $175p

Sold all my 6/19 calls (kinda too early, but profits). Left my $20 july calls

Yeah lol pretty sure there were a SHIT TON of 6/19 $50 calls bought during this dip... Idk why people are so worried

If it makes you feel any better I sold my 6/5 $288 calls a few weeks ago.. currently at 23.50ea.....

If it makes you feel any better I sold my SPY 6/5 $288 calls a few weeks ago.. currently at 23.50ea.....

Ford 6/19 5.5C calls are hella cheap right now...

Also had 6/5 $310c�s but a majority was in the 6/3�s. 

I�m so tempted to short right now but I always get burned betting against America

It's slightly late, but MGM 09/18 20C are only 3.12. Considering how low MGM is, I feel like that's a pretty big steal on such a long dated call

XOM 6/5 47p

MIK stock. 6/19 5c if you want options

Hold DIS 6/12 128 EOD or Cash out at 135%? is this the sell the news part? or will ppl FOMO into tomorrow?

I bought a 6/5 31c up 100% I got this morning. It�s about timing.

MGM 22 6/12 

THANK ME NOW

HAHA DKNG 42 06/12

MOTHA FUCKAAAAS

My 7/17 125C still -10% so have to hold into tomorrow.

I have regained confidence in my RTX 6/19 70c�s 

Carry on everyone.

accidentally purchased SNAP 20.5c 6/12 when I meant to purchase 6/19.  So much for discipline.

CHWY 50c 6/5  
DKNG 45c 5/5  
SNAP 20.5c 6/12

41 DKNG 6/5 is a steal

41 DKNG 6/5c is a steals officially confirmed.c

expiration date? Mine is 6/26 so i think im gonna hold another week, 100%+ currently

Hey guys it doesn't look like my SPY 6/30 250p is going to print. -93.55%.

What date? I�m thinking even 08/21 might be too soon

i Have 7/17 50 & 52.5

sorry guys i bought amd calls. i'm 5/5 on it going down when i buy calls. i'll let you know in advance next time

had 4 6/26 220c at 1.17 premium but sold for $100 loss when china talks started. couldve had a 4-5 times return. tear up a little every time i check the stock.

Spy 12/18 363/364c has 250000 open interest

MGM 21c 6/19 what you guys think?

Just curious. Why has TSLA 6/5 1000c volume more then doubled since open? Is this someone hedging?

It is pretty large but I picked up 10 $160 6/19 puts this morning.

cloudera literally free money up 126% on my 6/5 11C

Boing (BA) up a lot, but the spread is crazy. 7/10 225c Bid .25 ask 2.25.

for 6/5c moving down kinda quick rn though smh

I did a few mins ago. I bought 6/19 but fd will pay better but I got small pp

Looks like I can buy contacts for 7/17 $100p at .02 a piece. If these paid out the world may be over but I'd be RICH

Just snagged 5x $22c for 6/19 let�s go

What could go wrong when this whole sub owns DKNG 06/05 40c?

I�m sitting on 6/5 & 7/10

AMD going to start bouncing very soon, grab some 6/5 $53�s for easy money

My paper hands are trembling with DKNG.. I was so sure it would keep rising with the NBA announcement and then NFL later. I have 8/21 exp but this shit is killing me.

I think it�ll be soon but not totally sure so I got 06/26 $125c

It loves to run up on Fridays for some reason. Might have to hold it till then but 6/5 360�s are bleeding right now.

Just bought:

SPCE $18c 6/12
BA $175c 6/12
MGM 4x $22c 6/19
AMC 4x $3p 7/17

Just loaded up on 5/29 25c scratchers

WWE looking ripe for some 7/17 calls.

Thoughts on my DIS 7/17 $135 call? Hold or sell?

still bagholding 7/17 140c

Get those 5/29 25c they were dirt cheap and MGM going to be on the move baby!

Please Please Please do yourself a favor and grab some LMT $400 calls 7/2 or later. This thing is going to pop past $400 very soon and be at $420 in a couple weeks

Sitting bigly with my 4x gain on my $40 single contract CLDR 6/5 $10.5c. May just let this shit ride through earnings and lose it all bois.

Expired 6/5 so...

Revenge trade:

ZM 170p 6/26

Balls to the wall bruh

Alright everyone who's been holding YEXT STAND THE FUCK UP!!!!!!  Up 750% on my $17.5 6/19 I've been holding for a few weeks with earnings tomorrow.  Gonna sell half and let the rest ride.

So VTIQ, ticker is supposed to change tomorrow correct? Boomers love that shit. 06/05 calls

Damn, what's up with BA.  Bought 1/21 200c the other day for the hell of it and it's almost double

Donkey kong is not focused right now.. holding 6/5 hahah

I bought 6/12 307p for the hell of it

Man seeing comments like these make me want to baghold all my 6/19 calls...up 750% right now but if they moon I could be looking at 4000% returns

Launching free channel 6/15 so maybe not

I�ve got 6/19 45c wondering if I should cut losses. You think it�s a good play to hold. I�m down like 50%

vtiq 36 call exp 6/5 what theee fuck do I do today?

Yep I have three $42 6/12

I think I might make money here

2x SPY 315c 06/12

1x SPY 308c 06/10

TSLA looks ready to surge! 

Been building 900c 6/5 position and having a great day swinging TSLA in this range.

Would love it to get back over 890

My 6/5 309 puts approve of this

Why are they bags? I'm in deep for 7/17 C at various strikes.

MAT $11c 6/12

Thank me later.

My grandpa is a former stockbroker and has been trading for probably 45 years or more, but doesn't trade options at all. 

I've been talking to him about my plays lately just because I love my grandpa and it's something we're both interested in and I enjoy it, he bought some CFG 25c 6/19 apparently and called me today all excited about his gains

Puts on my grandpas retirement fund, I got a new one boys

I have 150 SPY 7/17 $335c, already + $6500 should I sell and reinvest or let'em ride?

I'm so fucking angry man.  Had 10 6/5 35c's that I day traded yesterday for a 130% return ($250).  Just scaling where I could.  If I just held those would be an extra $1,300 of profit and counting....

I mean it was up fucking 40% in 6 trading days. That is unsustainable. It was due for a pullback, but I would feel ok about any options that are at least 6/19 and away. Also for what it's worth I really like it as a long term hold. Sports betting is going to be legalized in every state in the future (3-5yrs).

if u want to lock in shit sell the same option except 1 strike out. like spy 6/5 310c is what u want to lock in. sell a spy 6/5 311c. u lock in everything and cant gain/lose without using a day trade

Easy money USFD 9/21 calls

Bought several $20 6/26 and $21 6/19 because they got cheap after the drop

Just bought $4,000 worth of SPY 6/3 311 puts yolo

Fastly 60C 6/19 lets go

It's gonna do something big one way or the other. I've got a 312c and 306p (both exp 6/5) so a big move either way should be ok for me. But I prefer up.

It�s helping me chill better. I can let it play a little longer. Usually I see shit dipping after I have a profit I want to bail. This way I take a little as I go. 

Earlier this week PFE shit the bed. Bought 50 6/19 36.5c. For .34. Started selling little by little. First at .37 just wanted some profit. 5 contracts there. And just gradually sold and kept a couple. I know if I held overnight I would have made more. It�s doubled and fallen today. But I was up double on the 2 contracts I held. But I�m tired of having overnight pajama traders decide my fate.

I bought a few FB 6/5 240C when it was 39. Hurts real bad.

DKNG 6/19 50c looking real tasty with the NBA News tomorrow. Gonna avg down on these

Did you ever have one of those days where you're waiting for the cable guy to show up, when 5 minutes before his arrival you think you got to fart but instead have a very liquidy start? And then you panic scrub yourself and hide the pair of underwear like a murder victim the second the door bell rings.

Anyway, RDSA 6/12 $35c

I mean most of my calls are 6/19 and 7/17 and in the money. I�m having a hard time closing bc delta and gamma are so powerful

LUV (Southwest) 12/18 Call $30 strike, got in at $4.35. Now $10.25 for 135%.

Do I baghold this shit? I can see LUV hitting $40 over summer but not sure if premiums > theta gang.

If I wanted to buy JPM C 7/2 $105  but the break even is $109 what does that mean the call is for $109 or does that mean I can�t sell for profit this it hits $109. My bad I know y�all hate these questions I�m just tryna redeem my everybody gets one

Now the real question is...diamond hands till tomorrow on $MGM expiry 6/5 $20 c

Just bought some 7/2 25c for 45 cents a piece we�ll see what happens

OTEX - 45c 5/19 is at .25 cents. just look at that potential

I think it still has room to run. I took some profits this morning from my 7/17 $55s and rolled the rest into 6/19 and 7/17 $60s

Could sell my AAL 12c 6/12 for a solid 60% right now, but I�m greedy and stupid

>If I wanted to buy JPM C 7/2 $105  but the break even is $109 what does that mean the call is for $109 or does that mean I can�t sell for profit this it hits $109. My bad I know y�all hate these questions I�m just tryna redeem my everybody gets one

Basically take the 105 and times it by the underlying beta of the stock when you bought the option by.  Divide that by 109 and you should get a number.

ZM $200p 6/5 for $88.

Got 6/5 40c, up +25% rn.  Holding strong but likely selling before earnings

Picked up some 6/19 and 7/17 $6 calls, and it's been the least retarded trade I've made today

If Docu beats earning y�all think it�s going to pump or completely dump. I�ve bought in and sold to buy in again at least 4/5 times making profit each time. 

Just bought in at the dip again hoping it gains some momentum through tomorrow. Wondering who�s testing fate and hold through earnings?

I got long 7/17 and 6/5c on aal fro and dal im up 75% i am holding the 6/5 calls but selling tomorrow

I just got 10 6/19 35

$15k into $MGM around 3pm. 6/19 $22 calls. Selling immediately at open.

Sold my RTX 6/19 calls off for a loss, keeping my later dates ones

Was at -19k overall until this morning so I�ll take the jump today to exit these shorter ones before theta starts eating my ass

Lesson learned - if you sell off for a nice profit and it keeps going up, don�t FOMO back in like a retard

I need to stop eyeing this ZM 6/5 215/220 put debit spread

SPR 35c 6/19 are .18 right now

Last time BA hit 180, SPR was at 35

SPR at 26 right now

Just saying

pls be right im deep into 6/5 52C

Why did I sell my DIS 125c 6/12 yesterday?

Because I am weak

MAC 6/19 6p looks bubbly

145 Call
Break even 156.90
6/12 expiration

Anyone else holding ESTC? 6/19 $100 here not sure if holding past earnings. CRWD and ZM mooned post earnings but IV loss barely compensates.

16.6k volume on spy 240p 7/2 WHY!? DID ONE OF YOU AUTISTS YOLO?

I have so many puts, I lost all my money last month buying puts after I missed out when I had made the right predictions.

I am ready to get rich or die trying, SPY 6/3 308P, TSLA 6/5 805P

I sold mine half of 6/5c and bought 23C 6/12 calls with the profit i made

Huge volume on HOG 11:50 green candle I'm liking my 6/5 26.5c

Boys at close today I�m closing out everything and allin DKNG 6/19 45c. Going to be the easiest money ever made.

Fuck, buying 6/5 puts for ZM

Just saw GNUS' website

GNUS @0.5 6/7 free money

My whole account is about to go on DKNG 6/19 $45c. That�s a double up by Friday.

sell Disney 7/17 eod or wait for announcement tomorrow...

Hmmmm got my eyes on 6/12 190 ZM puts convince me to pull the ole trigaroo

i�m buying 50c 7/26 if there�s another dip

I bought 2 $6c 6/15 for $15 each for shits and gigs yesterday. They were $70 this morning.. I fucking wish I bought a decent amount

I�ve got 7/17 I�m up 50% on after I doubled down on the dip. Hold those or go out even further?

NIO call holders what's the plan? Holding some 5c 7/17 up 400% but don't want to bloody sell.

Hold MGM 24.5c 7/17 ??

look at OI on AZN 56c 6/5 and tell me no one knew

55c 7/17 Oracle earnings next week.

Fly 8/21 $10c

I grabbed $340 6/30 calls because this market is about to get manic with people thinking they are getting left behind.

I got 7/2 $20c. Once they open up tomorrow should be a flood gate.

Are SNAP 19.5 calls 6/5 a good idea rn?

I have 7/17 calls already

PFE 6/5 $36c are dirt cheap considering they are a vaccine finalist. YOLO time

RH has the discover star thing that gives some pretty crazy plays that I�d call FD�s. like it recommended a BA 160 call for 6/5 and now look at today DEEEEEEP ITM

Cool idk what they do just bought 6/5 340c

I�m sitting on some 6/5 $55c that are fucking me but there�s still time I guess

I�m thinking about selling my SPY 07/17 307c at the end of the day, the last three days have been incredibly green there has to be some pull back right? 

Thoughts?

Still YOLOing after the MLB news? I got in on some 6/19 50c and just HURTING now

XOM 6/5 48p

Yeah debating. But I got 7/2 calls...so if it does dip I might have time to climb back up.

BAC 6/5 26.5c

Do I bite the bullet bought a shop 770 6/26 to flip today for a day trade down 8 percent. Sell for lose or hold

lol remember when i bought like 500 4/29 180p

This last hour is bleeding TSLA 6/5 call holders dry.

Literally 0 catalyst for appreciation and downward pressure with the MMs roasting everyone.

If you are buying a call here you will 100% lose money today.

I�m not touching MGM with a 20 foot pool right now. 

I�m kidding, 6/19 21C 10 contracts. Averaged at .85

ZM 190 6/19 puts, thoughts?

Oh damn. I only have 1 7/17 and a couple 8/21s tho so I'm good. That sucks tho

Should I hold these DKNG 6/5 41$ calls or eat the 20% loss and move on?

Idk but I have 7/17 65s and 70s so hopefully by 7/1 or theta will kill me

I have 110 6/19 puts, down 93%

Just bought 20K 9/20 40$ PFE CALLS.

This is my last play - Puts took over my entire saving accnt.

Am I retarded ?

with 6/5 expiration you're gonna get stomped by theta if it doesn't absolutely moon today. Sell by eod for sure -- but you could get a good spike during power hour.

im all in 

6/5 52C wish me luck

Have a 8/21 exp. just got wiped of all profits I had from last week but it�s okay. DKNG 45 eow

My $0.01 06/03 puts are with you on the loser train

Yolo�d on some 6/12 34c�s Fook it

moved all my 6/19 AMD calls to yoloing everything into 52C 6/5

is 7/17 long enough you think?

How much gas does Disney have in the tank for 6/26 or 7/2? I feel like they�re undervalued and those 145 calls are dirt cheap

lol wut?  last thursday was red.  And Tuesday, and Friday before that.  We literally alternated green/red from 5/18 to 5/29.

amd 6/5 52c

5/20 Closed 296.93.  5/21 Closed 294.88

5/27 Closed 303.53.  5/28 Closed 302.97

Thoughts on FANG 07/19 $55c.  What do you think the future holds for Diamondback Energy? Curious to know guy.  Thanks!

How high do we think LULU will go? Just got a 6/12 340c

Well, RIP to my DKNG 6/12 47C. I just wanted to be like WSB!

Playing earnings run-up, bought 7/2 $60c this morning as a complete yolo for fun and already up 75%

All you very smart bears should definitely buy 309 6/4 puts if you're sure of the impending eod drop

IGT has just fucking printed for me, currently 4x on my 6/19 10c that I bought 2 weeks ago

Spy 6/19 330c I bought over a joke I saw on WSB is printing

Idk why but I felt like buying facebook 7/17 250C

Am I stupid for getting SPY 6/19 315c

Bought 7/17 240c yesterday

Just one more contract, 6/5 95. Got greedy bc I sold ZS and ZM early and thought this would behave the same

I sold 16 contracts of SAVE 09/18 15c for 1.30 a few weeks ago hoping to buy back when it dips. It's worth 5.35 now

Fellas, I have WORK 32 C 6/5 and WORK 32.5 C 6/5.  Thinking about exercising them any thoughts?

Any reason to think TWTR is going down anytime soon? Up 150% on 6/12 $34.5c

Hold or sell TSLA 6/5 910c?

Was waiting for LULU cool down to load up on more 6/19 calls, but it�s keeps mooning to new ATH.

As someone who's in the industry, ie I run a butcher shop, this is my time to shine.

Just heard from suppliers meat supply is catching up. 

TSN 10/16 65C

I'm holding shares of AZN and MRNA as well as a 6/5 55.5c on AZN as a lotto. Hoping for a news pump!

Fb 240c 6/19 dumb or free money?

TSLA couldn�t punch through 888 so down it goes.

Just wait until the selling picks up.   I�m now in 6/5 900p.

MGM 22 6/5 safe or stay away??

BA printing for me today.  Now if SRNE can just eat shit and my $3.5p 7/17 can print it will be a great day.

I'm about to all in 6/5 315c and spend the next two days picking out my fleet of lambos

I have a 6/5 95c, I sold the other one for a big loss cuz I got scared, do I keep this and sell at open?

LMT $420 7/2 GO GO GO YOU AUTISTIC SONS OF BITCHES!

Fuck it. Just bought 4 07/17 340c. 

A $200 bet that this market stays retarded.

Just extend to 6/12 for safety

I bought $160 6/5 for $2 sold for $9.4

SPY 7/1 312C IS LITERALLY FREE MONEY

I hoped in for 6/5 fd�s. Hoping for a quick flip before exp.

lol i sold a 6/5 40C for .60 like an hour ago thankfully i still have some more but damn is this pump just gonna go up forever

Just yesterday this sub unanimously agreed (including me) that my 6/19 BUD 55cs had no shot. This truly is all random nonsense

Damn SPR really rallying eh?  6/19 35c's I bought barely an hour ago are already up 40%

in big on pfe, i thin their data will be good. 7/17 38c are what i got

I'm in on 6/19 46c, it's a rollercoaster

SPY 7/1 $330 in the house

Macy's 8c 6/5 you can get 50% up

ERI 6/5 40c

ERI 6/5 40c

Mgm 20 6/19 safer

Oracle is cheap rn my man I got a 54c expiring 6/13 and I copped 5 contracts. I don�t see why it wouldn�t trend upwards

Flipped some LVGO 6/19 $70c's for $1500 profit this morning. Only had 10 gooddamn contracts, smh. JBL gave me a few hundred on the $32 strike too. Everything else is red as hell!  Lol

I have 7/17 50c. You could go a bit further out of the money and I think you�d be safe. Others here have 55c and 60c for multiple July dates.

lol chinese airlines no longer allowed to fly to US. forget a trade war we�re going to actual war with GYNA. SPY 6/17 $350c

DKNG holding above 40.50. maybe my 6/26 $42c aren't dead yet. $5k depends on it, please at least give me my money back I don't even want to make anything! just break even!

Got in two days ago. 10/16 $20C

Sold my 6/5 15s for 1200%. Only $600 but still feels good. Still holding some other longer term positions. Can't see how this doesn't come roaring back as we reopen...

MSI 6/19 160c will be your next ten bagger. Cheap as fuck right now and with riots going on still police forces are going to buy big to ensure they have the communication supplies needed to deal with the riots. Surging today, and probably will up through the weekend

312 is strong. I closed out my 6/5 calls. Waiting until tomorrow

dude FUCK yes. congrats! i just about broke even as well. took out a $8k personal loan lol. time to pay it back and just play with my own money. if DKNG could stop shitting itself and if i could not lose any money i'll be golden. put 5k on some 6/22 42c and down 2k so far.. just hoping to break even here haha. happy for you tho, that's huge

I got 6/19 $45 at $2.04 average. $2.30 right now so I�m strapped in for a 2.5 bagger by Friday if it crosses $45

I dumped like 70%. Long calls too and held the 6/5 exp. Panicked. So dumb.

Rolled them into 7/17 for insurance.

Down 30% on spy 300 puts expiring 7/17 and have a terrible gut feeling. Cut losses next time we have a huge red day of like -.03% or diamond hand into insolvency?

damn VIX is back to 2/24 levels, corona officially cancelled

VIAC 29$ calls 7/2 exp. 


Trust.

Hold or sell VTIQ 6/5 $33c?

How retarded would I be to yolo a couple grand into BA 6/12 $200c's?

they always say that shit and i always fall fo rit

i'm falling for it again RN btw just bought a ton of 6/5 calls

Open interest on V 6/19 210 calls are insane... big move incoming??

I'm down like 80% on my IWM 7/17 puts.

Should have taken the 50% loss last week lol

Fuck this fake ass bullshit

HAHAHAHA last statement amazing. I'm biting my nails deciding whether to pull the trigger on 6/26 900c. As soon as I do it'll plummet even further.

Accidentally bought 6/5 call on VTIQ. Rip.

I had a 6/12 SPY 307c and a 310 call. Sold them when spy was at 306. AMA

CRWD 6/5 $110 saw some action. CEO on Cramer tn gonna talk about beating earnings. still pretty cheap

Sold half my 160C BA 8/21 for 120% gain, gonna let the other half keep running

Thank you MGM.. $18c 08/21 is easy money.

DONT YOLO YOUR GAINS BACK INTO A NEW TICKER

DONT YOLO YOUR GAINS BACK INTO A NEW TICKER

DONT YOLO YOUR GAINS BACK INTO A NEW TICKER

FUCK IT ALL IN VTIQ 6/19 35c

I have a DAL $30c 6/19 I've been holding onto. Was down huge on it for a while, now only about 30%. Sell today and take the small loss or hold?

grab YEXT 22.5 call 6/19 for earnings

Someone please tell me why WYNN 145c 9/18 is not free money? I just bought 50 at 1.03.

MARK is the most hilarious meme stock.  My 6/19 calls went from up 300% to down 50% to up 150% in the space of a week.  Stock is up 30% today.  Lol just lol.

DFS 6/5 55c

SPY 6/5 311c

XLF 6/12 24c

QQQ 6/12 241c

how fucked am i?

Damn hope
You guys happen on the Campbell�s soup recovery train. $49c 6/5 was $.45 at one point lmao. ITM now.

$39 6/12 LUV calls if you like money

TSLA barely above 282 before the next leg downs� under 880 in 15m and a huge sell off the last hour.  

Buying as many 6/5 850p right now as I can.

Lmao anyone here get the 4,000% from the 6/5 BA 185c?

>holdin 7/17 250c

Just saw 6/12 $220c are up 60 cents today. Holy Shit

Have 6/12 and 6/19..I�m tempted to sell

Just picked up a 6/19 $190p for 3.90

I had 6/5 I got out already lol gains are gains

YEXT 6/19 17.5 HURRY

Is VTIQ $44 6/5 to OTM

Right bro? good opportunities to make money.  Hope you didn't hold like me, didn't notice the 600% IV the other week was the reason those calls were up so high. I think it's just going up now because of the casinos reopening tomorrow, so I'm selling my 6/19 tomorrow or Friday and bought calls for a couple months out on last week's dip.

Sold today for ~33% gains on a bunch of $50c 7/17

Probably going to get back in on a dip

Bought 5 BA 250c 1/21 last week... they aren�t as sexy as weeklies but damn sure feels good to not get bent the fuck over.

thinking of selling most of my 12.5c 6/19 before close

Lulu 7/17 $400 because why tf not

UP 176% from MGM 07/02 20C - should I take profit or hold for more tomorrow..?

CLDR better not fail me. Prolly will cuz earnings are like 1/5 for me

why is ba soaring? am i a retard for hoping in 6/5 210c

Yeah I bought a 6/12 call this morning when it was around 880 on the downtrend thinking I had a fucking steal, now Im getting fucked.

VTIQ to NKLA tomorrow hope y�all jumped i. On that huge dip today. Going straight to tendie town, strike $30 6/19 $35 7/17 what I�m holding. Plus a fuck ton of warrants and shares

Ima strangle up some spy 6/5 15 minutes before close. What could possibly go wrong

ENPH down 6.66%. I think my 7/17 60c calls are fucked

24.5 7/10 for me

I was holding 10x 6/5 SPY 310c yesterday that I sold for a small loss. I cannot believe my single ply TP hands... would have printed haaard today. Oh well.

I just bought 1x SPY 300 6/12 Put.... why? I honestly do not understand this market and euphoria. It was $135.00 and I am happy to lose it.

VTIQ 6/5 $33 call

SPY is going to 313. Mark my words. YOLO on that. It likely isnt going down any further.

I would say sell 6/05 308-311 puts.

cldr who is holding? 6/19 12.50 call here

I want to do dis 120p 6/5 but that just seems so retarded

Guess I shoudl sell my 30p for 6/5 i have it as a hedge for my 7/17 40c

I�m holding 6/19c $137 I bought last week. I expect early morning jump Friday then slow decline. People have been saying that but given how the market has handled everything so far, I don�t expect a huge correction this soon. Just my opinion.

DKNG 6/29 45

Spy 6/3 puts bought at 312.37 up 66% so far

u think this gonna moon? i just got 6/5 calls

is tesla going to recover? i have a 290c 6/12 shaking

MGM 6/19 c. Really should sell but casinos are opening tonight on the strip, it may pop by morning. Any positive news seems to tank this market though. So conflicted!

I really fucked myself with these 6/5 770 SHOP calls. Down 40%.

I am thinking about selling as well... holding a few 90c 7/17 that I  got at 8.30. Might be worth to move the money elsewhere since I am only 3% up. Better than taking a loss or get stuck in a dead position for a few weeks.

BAC 7/17 30c has 26k volume. 6/5 calls also massive volume. Anybody know why?

I heard that MGMs resorts are already booked out for awhile. I think we should be alright. Holding July 2nd 17.5c and 7/17 20c.

Oh my God just bought VTIQ  6/19 33.5 calls I know I'm going to lose money

So tempting to buy spy 6/5 puts wow

HOLY SHIT MY SPY 6/3 PUTS BOUGHT AT 312.37 UP 100% ALREADY

Wait how did I buy $DOCU calls at $146.27 this noon (6/19 exp) and the price is nearly the same but my contracts are down 8%?  


Like I purchased 6/19 $145c at $10.50/contract and now they are worth $9.65/contract? Theta is only -0.27?

MARK 3c 1/21 (wait for better entry, promising AI tech that just got their shit together)  
ON 20c 7/17 (semiconductor player moving to the big leagues)  
FCEL 3c 7/17 (earnings soon. maybe NKLA fuel cell hype will pump FCEL)

I'm holding 6/19 $20 until the end of the week.

If Starlink launches tonight there should be somewhat of a gap up.   Probably not as crazy as over the weekend but I would expect something.   

Who knows it could make it fucking moonshot. 

My 6/12 FD Call really fucking hopes so lol

my spy puts for 6/8 bought at open down 22% fked. let the rug pull commence!

wait it doesn't expire til 7/2 and will go up more

Should i sell my June 5th VTIQ put i got at 110 currently down 40. It�s a small insurance for my 7/17 40c calls

>%. Why did that work?  
>  
>ReplyGive AwardshareReportSave

I got 6/19 45c that are down 44%. Hoping for a greeen day tomorrow

Is that why there was a huge 1000c 6/5 volume increase? it was like 13k

GO VTIQ GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 6/12 $33c from 1.8 back to 3.75 today.

Hold these 6/5 307 calls or use a day trade EOD?

I'm 5/5 trading SPCE options and just grabbed calls. C'mon lads, let's get it!

Do I just say fuck it and hold my DKNG calls for 6/5 through tomorrow's announcement? Or cut my losses. That's basically my last shot.

is this a bad WRTC straddle? it feels retarded..

8x 7.5p 6/19
3x 7.5c 6/19
2x 10c 6/19

SPCE 6/5 18C

MRK has 2 priority revies thsi month:

6/04 for a pneumonia ventilator stuff

6/16 for a tumors thingy.  

CALLS CALLS CALLS!

Yessirr. Already up 10% on my calls. 6/19 $53, bought at $52.50. might cash out tomorrow if it moons. Don't wanna hold too long

Bought 3 $15 CLDR calls for 6/12 for $90 lol

Boys, where are we going with MGM? I�m at like 150% profit on these 7/20 23c�s that I got dirt cheap. Does it have more momentum or are we played out? I know it historically runs 25-30, but I�m a bit inexperienced with big games stocks.

same man got $54 6/19 i think its set up for a big breakout but wanna take profits as they come

My 6/12 $31 calls are priiiiiinting

Why oh why did I buy SPY $311 6/5 puts today

Just dumped money on 311p 7/17 so I hope that�s a dumb move

I�m selling half today but I have 6/19 expirations

MU, ER 6/29

DD is simple tech go up, MU go up

Shoulda put my whole portfolio in BA 6/5 170 I got this morning when it started going up

better than my $310p 6/3 choice

I mean now is a better entry point, however as long as you bought something between 290 and 310 7/2 or later I�d say you aren�t retarded.

Same, 6/12 $30c

I sold off my 6/5 stuff at about noon today, still sitting on 6/19, bought more for 7/17, and have a couple hundred shares at 17 cost basis

I know I'm worried about nothing, I just want every tendie SPR will give me

308p 6/12 loaded. SHOW ME THE FUCKING PULLBACK

310p 6/5
One small dump pls

Hoping I didn't just buy RTX at the top - holding 6/26 $70c

Holding 7/02 MGM calls. Up 140% already. Hold or sell?

Shit do o gotta dump my VSTO and WRTC 6/19 calls

Someone still super bullish on UAL and bought 5,000 6/12 45c

God damn these SPY 311c 6/5 I got yesterday are treating me right

my spy $320 6/5 is up over 100%. Crazy

It might just be me, but I'm real skeptical about the close today.  We pushed this far, and now I think we might dump into close.  Closing out half my 6/19 $312 calls might be the good thing for me to do here.  And pick up a single $310p as a hail mary for 6/5

Till 7/2 45c

Yup, same here. Liquidated 3/4 of my position (was up almost 100%) and letting  about $900 ride through. Fingers crossed

Can�t post of this stupid image rule, but bought 7.4k puts (100 for each upvote yesterday). P312 6/8 today. They�re down around 2k right now.

Holding until expiry but that�s what I get for yoloing my plays.

BA calls be printing today , 7/17 190C is up 300%

Are people ditching tsla 6/5 calls or holding through until tomorrow?

just sold my 70c for 6/5 FDs for profit LOL

Just got SPY 6/10 $315c these better print tomorrow

get some long term calls.

im holding 7/17 70c, 8/21 75c 9/19 95c to the end

ZM $300 7/17 printing, I thought I would be depresso dog today after seeing that $198 yesterday, but we zoooming per pow agenda. Thank you golden god J-Pow!

KO 7/17 50

Should I dump my WFC 07/02 $30 calls while I'm ahead or see what happens over the next week?

315 6/8 C???

Casino stocks. LVS MGM WYNN 7/17 just OTM calls.

Come on big dildo of glory. I'm so close to making some real money if UVXY keeps dropping. 270 6/19 20p.

Sell 3/4 lock in some gains

RGR 7/17 72.5 calls

I think I should say bye to my SPY 304p 6/3 now.

My 7/2 $20.5c wouldn�t mind so yea let�s do it!

Sometimes I wish I did research into a stock before I buy calls

I just bought a COTY 5$ 6/5 call.  Random 10$ bet

Yessiree, 7/17 55c

BA 6/19 $167.5c 

Sell or let it ride??

I sold my calls and bought my 308 6/5 exp when I posted my trade earlier today. I could've waited but that's hindsight. I don't find it surprising since we all think alike here...

who ever keeps undercutting COTY $6c 6/26 i hope the looters get you tonight my calls have gone DOWN on this fuckign EOD run

I took profit on my 6/5 and opened back up more 6/5 positions

CRWD 100c 7/17 what we doing boys??

That�s what I�ve heard. I bought two contracts 6/5 95c. Sold one at 98 today for a 240 loss. Saving the other one, will Cramer give it a good rating?

free 50% play: GWRE 7/17 $115 calls

omfg...Robinhood excutions are terrible. BA 180 Calls 6/12 were showing $1.4 but right after I bought it, it dropped to $1.25??? How doesn't it have that big of a gap..and yes I did check the ask and bid prices before buying at $1.4.

Hello. I'm the proud owner of a 6/3 310p. AMA

Sell. Buy back in if it dips tomorrow. 6/12 is pretty close.

I got 6/5 57.5 calls. Sell or hold?

I stayed in on all my casinos. I think tomorrow is going to be a big day. Wouldn't be surprised if mgm touches 23.5. 

Holding my $21c 6/12 for tomorrow.

XLE 1/21 calls was the best trade i ever made... fuck the weekly yolo�s

I�m holding my 6/5c $220 I bought prior to earnings. Might get back to even at this rate lol I was down like 95% at one point

$7 7/17 COTY are up baby!!

Ya know what. I'm holding these stupid fucking 6/5 50c on DKNG, even if they expire worthless as shit. Fuck it.

Is it autistic if I don�t sell these 6/5 307 Calls I bought for 2.30 now trading at 6.38?? The delta is just so sexy I love watching the market go up

Quick sell them and just buy 6/12 calls.

I'm selling 1/3 tommorow before close, selling 1/3 the morning after earnings whichever way things go, and holding the rest (6/19 calls).  I have high hopes for earnings but I've been burned before (NET, PLAN, PLT)

Wow I forgot I placed an order this morning. Just bought 100 SPY 307 6/5 for 5k lmao

Didn�t see a 7/6 spot... Fake new$

Bought 6/26 230c after earnings and up 95% think I should continue to hold...

Agreed but I�ve got 6/5 calls!

some dude posted with a screen shot in the Webull comments that he he sold his shares on 5/18 for .95 a piece... oof.

I don�t know how much it�ll go up. 

I�ve got 195 6/19 call that�s made me $1560 today tendies

Having a hard time deciding if I should sell my MGM 6/19 23c or hold overnight.   Why must decisions be difficult?

Fully expecting DKNG to moon tomorrow because I bought $40 6/5 puts this morning. You�re welcome autists.

My SPY 220P 6/19 doing okay?

Probably the 100th comment to ask this, but are the true autists holding CLDR overnight through earnings?  

I think I'll sell my 6/5 $11c before close but hold my 6/26 $11c contracts.

Why is there such low volume on SPY 8/21 Calls?

MSFT $200 1/21 if you want money

Save, BA and Spy 07/17 spy calls for me going into tomorrow

> Quick sell them and just buy 6/12 calls.

Lol no. Why bother with the fees? I can just buy DKNG calls if I want to. I'm already down like 70-80%.

Dis 6/5 122c fuck, I don�t wanna hold overnight.  Anyone else?

Selling UNH 06/05 290p like hotcakes

SPY 06/12 306p

hold ZM 6/5 puts or sell?

My PINS 6/12 $21c calls are up 180% - hold or take profits? bout at .38 and currently trading at 1.05

Bought a 6/5 315 just to get some tendies if there is a small pull back tomorrow morning. Longer term I�m holding 7/1 2x SPY 313C though.

Sell it and pick up some 8/21 150C�s

holding these 9/18 25c

vtiq $55c 6/5 at close WITNESS

This plus a very optimistic fwd looking PE at 120+ is why I bought 8/21 puts.  But the market can stay irrational longer than my puts can stay solvent so see you @ the breadlines in august!

I just bought a 50C 6/12 because of this

I mean, seriously though?  I mean, what, "cause the bars are open"?.. (with 1/4 of the people allowed in)

Bought SPY puts for the first time in months. 6/5 310p

TSLA max pain for 6/5 is 850.  How many retards still bag holding 900c?

0% chance of that tomorrow and when TSLA gaps down you are toasty.

Buying 850p this afternoon was a no brainer.

DAL 6/19 30c. Decent move? Or am I dumb?

Riding hard.

BA 15 190c 6/5 lottos

SPR 50 35c 6/19

Lol jumped in VTIQ 50c 6/12 with 8 seconds left in the market

38c 6/12

38c 6/19

If spy doesn�t get to 295 by 6/12 then this bear will start to go to bears anonymous meetings

Split the difference: 6/19 200!!!

ZNGA kept sliding, decided to bail on 8/21 $13c, never really had much faith to start

bought 13c for cldr.. let's go..

sold my 1/21 15c for a 400% gain.

Cramer pump tonight, massive volume on 6/5 110c

started day at 42.2k -> was at 45.01k by 11am ended day with 43.3k.. ughhh soo close.. left only one position overnight.. 2 ESTC 7/17 95s.. gonna rest easy tonight

That's probably a retarded play, but I really want you to make bank on it, because I've got 6/19 $38c, so we'll both be rich.

locked in my profits with my 20c early in the day at the top, got in 22c 6/26 right after looking to sell eod tomorrow

Dkng 6/5 45c and 6/19 50c, holding on it'll rebound

Pussied out of tech calls after being up 15%. Threw 1400 at 6/19 315c at 3:59 though

I sold ZUO 12C 6/19 that I had held for a week a few days ago at a 5% profit. AMA

wow.. sold CLDR 30sec before close and kept 2 ESTC 7/17 95s

$49c 6/5 was $.85. Down a bit in the last 10 minutes but I�m hoping it recovers tomorrow.

I'm with ya pal. Crazy how a 50/50 can be wrong almost 100% of the time lol

I cashed out 311 6/15 this morning but made $$400 off two calls lmao coulda prolly tripled that holding but I figured I�ll just buy a call hedge tomorrow. Bought a 311 put today for Monday down 50 but I think it�ll be okay

AVGO & SQ were monsters today. 

I took profit on 2/3 of my AVGO 310C�s today. Left about 2k in freebie runners for ER tomorrow.

Same but as theta gang, sold 6/12 30p

Whoever bought mu SPY $310p 6/3 @$.01 around 4:10, thanks for the charity.

Sold 6/12 308 at open... Had I held, would've made $2k more haha.  But I still made money :-)

bought the EOD spy dip. Loaded up on 315 and cheap 7/17 339c

cldr will rebound but those short calls exp 6/5 are fucked

I was in 7/17 30c back in April.  At the tine they were 1.03 each
